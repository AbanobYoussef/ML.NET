22	area-System.Numerics	Two Numerics Tests are failing only on our CI server	Two of the tests in our System.Numerics.Vectors suite are failing only on our CI build server, and potentially only intermittently:  Vector2NormalizeTest1 Vector4NormalizeTest2  Given that these are very similar to other tests which cover a similar edge-case (especially the Vector3 normalization tests, which aren't failing), we will need to investigate why these tests in particular are failing on our build server. This may have been a point-in-time issue as we brought up our build infrastructure, and may not re-surface again.

41	area-System.Numerics	Quaternion operator overloads should be using the respective methods	Quaternion declares a handful of methods to perform addition, subtraction and multiplication, and provides the respective overloads for these operations.  However, instead of re-using the `Add`, `Multiply` etc. methods, the code is re-written in the operator overloads. The operators should be using their respective methods rather than re-declaring the same code.  This is under the assumption that the JIT inlines the methods when they are used in the operator overloads. 
49	area-Infrastructure	Add Linux/Mac build script	A `build.sh` should be added alongside `build.cmd` to build corefx on Linux/Mac.

71	area-System.Numerics	Behaviour of `Quaternion.CreateFromAxisAngle` when axis is not a unit vector	"The resulting quaternion depends on the length of `axis`. This does not describe a rotation and thus does not match the documentation.  There are a few ways to handle this issue: 1. Normalize `axis`, but this incurs a performance hit 2. Add a precondition that `axis.Length()` ? 1.        But enforcing that pre-condition is about as expensive as 1), so it'd probably need to be a documentation-only precondition. Unfortunately this means that consumers will rely on the current behaviour even if it's undocumented, so I don't think that this is a good solution. 3. Document the current behaviour  ---  Just for convenience, the relevant source code:  ``` /// <summary> /// Creates a Quaternion from a vector and an angle to rotate about the vector. /// </summary> /// <param name=""axis"">The vector to rotate around.</param> /// <param name=""angle"">The angle, in radians, to rotate around the vector.</param> /// <returns>The created Quaternion.</returns> public static Quaternion CreateFromAxisAngle(Vector3 axis, float angle) {     Quaternion ans;      float halfAngle = angle * 0.5f;     float s = (float)Math.Sin(halfAngle);     float c = (float)Math.Cos(halfAngle);      ans.X = axis.X * s;     ans.Y = axis.Y * s;     ans.Z = axis.Z * s;     ans.W = c;      return ans; } ``` "
72	area-System.Numerics	`Equals` with NaN values (IEEE vs. reflexivity)	The built in floating point types compare `NaN` as unequal when using `==` and `!=` (following IEEE semantics) but compare it as equal when using the `Equals` method.  Your floating point based types currently use IEEE semantics even for `Equals`. I suggest using the same behaviour as the built in types in your floating point based types like vectors or quaternions.  The  MSDN documentation of `Equals` contains an exception that allows `A.Equals(A)` to return false on floating point types, so you don't strictly violate its contract. But returning false still breaks hash tables and does not match the behaviour of the built in types, so I consider it a bad idea.  This can be avoided by calling `Equals` on the members instead of `==` in the implementation of `Equals` but not in `==` and `!=`.  For example with quaternion,  replace  ``` public bool Equals(Quaternion other) {     return (X == other.X &&             Y == other.Y &&             Z == other.Z &&             W == other.W); } ```  with  ``` public bool Equals(Quaternion other) {     return (X.Equals(other.X) &&             Y.Equals(other.Y) &&             Z.Equals(other.Z) &&             W.Equals(other.W)); } ```  You might want to add tests that check that `==` and `!=` compare all the above cases as unequal, so that they match the IEEE specification.  Replace:  ``` // Counterintuitive result - IEEE rules for NaN comparison are weird! Assert.False(a.Equals(a)); Assert.False(b.Equals(b)); Assert.False(c.Equals(c)); Assert.False(d.Equals(d)); ```  with:  ``` // Equals does not follow IEEE semantics since many consumers rely on equality being reflexive. // This includes collections like `Dictionary<K,V>` or `HashSet<T>` Assert.True(a.Equals(a)); Assert.True(b.Equals(b)); Assert.True(c.Equals(c)); Assert.True(d.Equals(d));  // Counterintuitive result - IEEE rules for NaN comparison are weird! Assert.False(a == a); Assert.False(b == b); Assert.False(c == c); Assert.False(d == d);  Assert.True(a != a); Assert.True(b != b); Assert.True(c != c); Assert.True(d != d); ``` 
77	area-System.Xml	Some Xml encoding tests lost their encoding	Some of Xml tests were testing problematic characters in different Encoding (like Russian characters). At some point few years back the encoding was lost while moving between different repos. Tests pass because .cs files lost their encoding too. Tests need to be rewritten since there is no trace of original copy

94	area-Meta	Necessary bits for Mono.Posix	I tried to build [Mono.Posix](https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/mcs/class/Mono.Posix) against aspnetcore50 and found a lot of API that mono uses to be missing from .NET Core most prominently in the Interop-domain (like CustomMarshaler).  Please add Mono.Posix to your list of scenarios that can benefit from the API surface of .NET Core. 
110	area-System.Xml	Add async document/element loading for XLinq.	Adds XElement.LoadAsync and XDocument.LoadAsync. Code from the sync versions has been largely lifted out so they can share an implementation as much as possible. 
116	area-System.Numerics	Quaternion and public fields	Is there a reason that the Quaternion struct has public exposed fields versus read only properties? Seems to be against the general guidelines for structs and immutability. Why would you want to allow X, Y, Z and W to be set outside of the ctor?

141	area-System.Numerics	Added .ToArray() and .FromArray() for Vector types	This commit adds Vector2.ToArray(), Vector2.FromArray(float[]), Vector3.ToArray(), Vector3.FromArray(float[]), Vector4.ToArray() and Vector4.FromArray(float[]). The FromArray method copies the array elements to a vector: the element at index 0 becomes X, the element at index 1 becomes Y and so on. The ToArray() method converts the vector to an array: it puts X at index 0, Y at index 1 and so on.  These methods looked useful to me if you have an array but want to do vector operations. 
142	area-System.Numerics	Vector2 and Vector3 Projection	The current source includes public static methods for reflection of a vector about a unit vector normal but the underlying vector projection is also useful by itself.  Proposing:  ``` C# public static Vector2 Project(Vector2 vector, Vector2 component) { ... } //... public static Vector3 Project(Vector3 vector, Vector3 component) { ... } ```  I'll wait for feed back before trying to submit a pull request. 
144	area-Infrastructure	All the linked files are in the root folder of the XML projects.	When you reference files outside the project directory, such as the common directory in the XML code case, these links by default show up in the root of the project in VS which is very annoying and clutters the solution unnecessarily. We should add the appropriate <Link> metadata to these Compile items so that VS will group them correctly in the solution explorer.

176	area-System.Linq	System.Linq.Parallel Tests are Failing on AppVeyor Machines	The following 5 tests are failing (some intermittently) on our AppVeyor CI builds. I haven't investigated deeply, but I suspect it has to do with the limited hardware that the VM's are equipped with. Some of the test explicitly test whether multiple threads are created, which might not even be the case in an underpowered VM.

201	area-System.Numerics	Vector2/Vector3 could implement operator overloads	For the sake of intuitive use, Vector2 and Vector3's `Public operator methods` could be extended with actual operator overloads.  This promotes intuitive usage where `var vec = vecA * vecB;` is assumed to be more programmer-friendly than `var vec = Vector3.Multiply(vecA, vecB);`.  I'm looking forward to your thoughts. 
218	area-System.Console	Add tests for System.Console library	
219	area-System.Runtime	Consider adding API to return common Funcs and Actions without reallocating	See pull request #181: In that case, caching was proposed for System.Linq.Parallel. This means that other libraries can't share the same cache (which can grow by the number of generic instantiations). Furthermore, since the actual call sites affected in PLINQ were already allocating considerably, it is doubtful that PLINQ would benefit from the optimization.  We should study if we can design public API in the BCL in the same vein as the new `Array.Empty<T>().`  _Before_ we do this, we should: 1. Gather data about how many places we have across the stack that would benefit from these shared allocations and find use cases in more compelling places than PLINQ. 2. Design the API. We can use this issue to discuss and evolve it in to a mini-spec. Here's an idea just to get that ball rolling on that.  ``` C# namespace System {     public static class CommonAction {         public static Action Empty { get; }     }     public static class CommonFunc {         public static Func<T, bool> AlwaysTrue<T>();         public static Func<T, T> Identity<T>();         public static Func<TArgument, TType> IsInstanceOf<TArgument, TType>();         public static Func<TArgument, TType> Cast<TArgument, TType>();     } } ```

231	area-System.Text	Improve performance of Regex ctor and IsMatch	"The Regex class maintains a cache of byte codes, which the Regex ctor indexes into using a key.  It uses this seemingly innocuous line to create that key:  ``` C# String key = ((int)options).ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo) + "":"" + cultureKey + "":"" + pattern; ```  This, however, has the unfortunate effect of allocating a string for the options, a string array for the five strings to be passed to the String.Concat call generated by the compiler, another string array allocation inside of Concat, and then the resulting string for the whole operation.  The cost of those allocations is causing a non-trivial slowdown for repeated Regex.IsMatch calls for simple regular expressions, such as for a phone number (e.g. from the MSDN docs ""^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}$"").  This commit adds a new struct key type that just stores the constitutent options, cultureKey, and pattern, rather than creating a string to store them.  That key is then what's stored in each entry in the cache.  For repeated Regex.IsMatch calls for basic regular expressions like the phone number one previously mentioned, on my machine this improves throughput by ~35%, in large part due to an ~80% reduction in number of allocations, and (for this particular test case) an ~70% reduction in number of bytes allocated (it depends primarily on the length of the pattern and the length of the culture name).

241	area-System.Linq	Fix multiple projects for optimizations, debug/trace, etc.	System.Linq.Parallel.csproj wasn't outputting symbols, and it didn't have optimizations enabled in Release.  System.Numerics.Vectors.csproj was setting TRACE in Release builds but not in Debug builds.  System.Text.RegularExpressions.csproj wasn't setting either DEBUG nor RELEASE constants in either Debug/Release builds, it didn't have optimizations enabled in Release, and it wasn't generating symbols in either.  The XML libraries were't setting DEBUG/TRACE in either Debug/Release builds, weren't enabling optimizations in Release builds, and weren't generating symbols in either.  DEBUG is important in almost all of these libraries, as they use Debug.\* for asserts and the like.  Symbol generation is important for debugging.  Optimizations are obviously important (but just to verify I saw significant performance wins in multiple libraries just from turning this on in release).  TRACE isn't really important, as none of the libraries do release tracing, but I thought it good hygiene to enable it. 
247	area-Meta	Add Security transparency	Since Code Access Security is a thing of the past with .NET Core, I wouldn't expect permissions or security attributes to be used (or even to exist).  I didn't see permissions anywhere in the current code: they seem to have be completely removed from .NET Core as expected.  However, [several committed files](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/search?q=SecurityCritical+OR+SecuritySafeCritical&type=Code) still use `SecurityCriticalAttribute` or `SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute`. Is this a left-over from the .NET framework code? I expect so, since they mean nothing without permission checks. If this is intended, what are the guidelines about using them? 
249	area-System.Collections	Memory allocation documentation for ImmutableDictionary Keys and Values	## Background  As described in #246 (and previously in #147), the `Keys` and `Values` properties of `ImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue>` cannot be used without incurring memory allocations on the heap. However, a slight modification of user code provides _equivalent_ behavior without these allocations.  With allocations:  ``` csharp foreach (var key in dictionary.Keys) {     ... } ```  Without allocations:  ``` csharp foreach (var pair in dictionary) {     var key = pair.Key; } ``` ## Suggestion  Since updating the `Keys` and `Values` properties to eliminate the allocations would be a breaking change (#246), the only recourse is to update the documentation for these properties to describe steps a user can take to avoid allocations if these properties are used heavily within a particular application. ## Caveat  Care must be taken to ensure that the documentation does not read in a way that suggests the `Keys` and `Values` properties should not be used. The properties behave properly and would not be even a measurable source of time spent in the application in nearly all cases. This notice is only meant for users making heavy use of these properties who are also actively working to reduce the memory allocations performed within an especially performance-sensitive section of code.

262	area-System.Reflection	System.Reflection.Metadata should provide easier signature reading API	**EDIT** 12/3/2015 - Replaced entire description with the detailed proposal matching PR #4809  Today, System.Reflection.Metadata provides low-level access to ECMA-335 CLI metadata, but only provides signatures as blobs that must be parsed with direct knowledge of the format as described in the section II.23.2 of the CLI specification. There is a `BlobReader` for reading various elements out of blobs, but it is up to the caller to read the right things at the right positions.   This was by-design as the library is designed to sit at the lowest level behind the scenes of higher level API such as Reflection proper, Roslyn, or CCI.  The challenge with signatures is that they are variable-length and encode tree structures, and each higher level model that could sit on top of System.Reflection.Metadata will have different representations for the trees. We do not want to introduce an API to build a fully-formed tree that then has to be traversed and rewritten to match the actual use case.   This proposal is therefore a middle ground between: 1. Here are the bytes and some helpers. Read the spec to decode. (Status quo) 2. Yet another high-level metadata API. (Out-of-scope for this layer)  It works as follows: 1. The caller chooses an arbitrary representation, `TType`, for type symbols and implements `ISignatureTypeProvider<TType>`. (See full API spec below). 2. Signatures are parsed by recursive descent and the provider is called to create new type nodes: - _Give me the `TType` that represents this primitive_ - _Give me the `TType` that represents this TypeDefinition_ - _Give me the `TType` that represents an array of this other TType_ - _etc._ # Sample Usage  Given a suitable  `TypeSymbol` and `TypeSymbolProvider : ISignatureTypeProvider<TypeSymbol>`, here is code walking all of the `TypeSymbol`'s for every field, parameter, and return type:  ``` C# using (var stream = File.OpenRead(pathToDll)) using (var peReader = new PEReader(stream)) {     var reader = peReader.GetMetadataReader();     var provider = new TypeSymbolProvider();      foreach (TypeDefinitionHandle typeHandle in reader.TypeDefinitions)     {          TypeDefinition type = reader.GetTypeDefinition(typeHandle);           foreach (FieldDefinitionHandle fieldHandle in type.GetFields())          {               FieldDefinition field = reader.GetFieldDefinition(fieldHandle);               TypeSymbol fieldType = field.DecodeSignature(provider);               // ...          }           foreach (MethodDefinitionHandle methodHandle in type.GetMethods())          {               MethodDefinition method = reader.GetMethodDefinition(methodHandle);               MethodSignature<TypeSymbol> methodSig = method.DecodeSignature(provider);               TypeSymbol returnType = methodSig.ReturnType;               // ...                foreach (TypeSymbol parameterType in methodSig.ParameterTypes)               {                   // ...               }          }     } } ``` # Full API ## Additions to existing types  These provide convenience entry points. There are other use cases where you want to parse only part of a signature or a signature that you did not obtain from the metadata reader. For that, the `SignatureDecoder`  ``` C# namespace System.Reflection.Metadata  {     public struct FieldDefinition     {         public TType DecodeSignature<TType>(             ISignatureTypeProvider<TType> provider,              SignatureDecoderOptions options=SignatureDecoderOptions.None);     }      public struct MemberReference     {         public TType DecodeFieldSignature<TType>(             ISignatureTypeProvider<TType> provider,              SignatureDecoderOptions options=SignatureDecoderOptions.None);

267	area-System.Text	Remove superfluous internal access modifier	I'm not sure I see the point in having the internal modifier on these fields, but if I'm missing something feel free to close. 
271	area-System.Text	Regex collections should implement generic collection interfaces	"`CaptureCollection`, `GroupCollection`, and `MatchCollection` currently only implement the non-generic `ICollection` interface. These collections should implement the generic collection interfaces to better interoperate with more modern APIs, such as LINQ. Since these collections are already indexable, they should implement  `IList<T>` and `IReadOnlyList<T>`, as well as the non-generic `IList` (to be consistent with the generic interfaces). ## Rationale and Usage  This is certainly a nice-to-have, but it _is_ a long-standing [request](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/469250/capturecollection-groupcollection-and-matchcollection-do-not-implement-icollection-t-and-ienumerable-t) that [developers](http://stackoverflow.com/q/7274422) [still](http://jimlynn.wordpress.com/2009/11/04/why-cant-i-use-linq-on-a-capturecollection/) [ask](http://stackoverflow.com/q/16379433) [about](http://stackoverflow.com/q/4108956). Implementing the generic interfaces will allow these collections to be used more easily with LINQ and interoperate better with more modern framework and library APIs.  For example, to use these collections with LINQ right now you have to know about and remember to use `Enumerable.Cast<TSource>()` to cast the non-generic `IEnumerable` into an `IEnumerable<T>`:  ``` c# var captures =     from capture in match.Groups.Cast<Group>().Last().Captures.Cast<Capture>()     select capture.Value; ```  With these changes you'd no longer have to do that:  ``` c# var captures =     from capture in match.Groups.Last().Captures     select capture.Value; ```  Plus, in the above example, you'd get a performance improvement when using `Enumerable.Last<TSource>.()` as its implementation has a fast-path for collections that implement `IList<T>`. ## Proposed API  ``` c# // DebuggerDisplay and DebuggerTypeProxy added [DebuggerDisplay(""Count = {Count}"")] [DebuggerTypeProxy(typeof(RegexCollectionDebuggerProxy<Capture>))] // Previously only implemented ICollection public class CaptureCollection : IList<Capture>, IReadOnlyList<Capture>, IList {     // Existing members     public int Count { get;

set; } }  ``` ## Details - There was some discussion as to whether only the read-only interfaces should be implemented, or both the read-only and mutable interfaces. The consensus is to implement both the read-only and mutable interfaces. This is consistent with other collections in the framework. The mutable interfaces are implemented as read-only: mutable members are implemented explicitly and throw `NotSupportedException` (like `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`). - There was an open question as to whether the non-generic `IList` should be implemented as well. These collections are indexable and if  `IList<T>` and `IReadOnlyList<T>` are being implemented, `IList` should be implemented as well. This does add several more members, but they are all implemented explicitly so they don't add any new public members to intellisense, and the implementations are very straightforward. - `ICollection<T>.CopyTo` is implemented implicitly (public). - All other new members are implemented explicitly (non-public):   - Mutable members are implemented explicitly because these collections are read-only and the mutable members throw `NotSupportedException` (like `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`).   - `IList` members are implemented explicitly to hide non-generic members from intellisense.   - `IList<T>.IndexOf` and `ICollection<T>.Contains` are implemented explicitly because these methods aren't very useful for these collections and should not be visible in intellisense by default. They're not useful because an implementation using `EqualityComparer<T>.Default` (consistent with other collections) will search the collection using reference equality due to the fact that `Capture`, `Group`, and `Match` do not implement `IEquatable<T>` and do not override `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()`. Further, these types do not have public constructors -- they are created internally by the regex engine, making it very unlikely that you'd want to search for an item in a collection ""A"" that was obtained from collection ""B"".   - `IEnumerable<T>.GetEnumerator()` must be implemented explicitly because the non-generic `IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()` is already implemented implicitly and we can't overload on return type. This also precludes returning a `struct` `Enumerator` (for better enumeration performance) because changing the return type of the existing method would be a binary breaking change. As a result, you'll still have to specify the type when using `foreach` (e.g. `foreach (Capture capture in captures)`); you won't be able to use `var` (e.g. `foreach (var capture in captures)`), unfortunately. ## Open Questions - Should `GroupCollection` implement `IDictionary<string, Group>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, Group>`, and `IDictionary`? `GroupCollection` already has a string indexer. Is it worth implementing the dictionary interfaces as part of this? Personally, I'm leaning toward ""no"" because there isn't a compelling scenario for the dictionary interfaces, and they can always be added in the future when needed. ## Pull Request  A PR with the proposed changes is available: #1756 ## Updates - Edited this description to make it more of a _speclet_, based on the discussion below and the proposed API Review process. - Some improvements based on feedback from @sharwell. - Fixed existing members. - Added `IList`. These collections are indexable and it would be strange if `IList<T>` and `IReadOnlyList<T>` were implemented alongside `ICollection` but without `IList`. - Added `DebuggerDisplay` and `DebuggerTypeProxy` attributes. - Made `ICollection<T>.CopyTo` implicit (public).

277	area-System.Text	Update regular expressions collections to implement IReadOnlyList<T>	Fixes #271   I believe this is the least intrusive path to implementing the requested functionality.  I considered the following items but decided to not include them with this pull request. - `GroupEnumerator` is internal, so it might be possible to change the type of `GroupEnumerator.Capture` from `Capture` to `Group`. This would make the explicit cast in the generic `Current` property unnecessary. - I did not update `CaptureCollection` to implement `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, Capture>`, primarily because it's a larger change with the addition of the `Keys` and `Values` properties (even if they are explicitly implemented). This should probably be reviewed independently from a straightforward implementation of `IReadOnlyList<T>`.

294	area-Meta	Proposal for the API Review process	Now that were on GitHub we also get requests for new APIs. The current API review process is designed around the assumption that it is internal-only. We need to rethink this process for an open source world. This issue represents a proposal how this could be handled. Its not final  any feedback is highly appreciated. ## Process Goals  The key goals are: - **Designed for GitHub**. In order to be sustainable and not be a hurdle for contributors the API review process must feel natural to folks familiar with GitHub. - **Efficiency**. Performing API reviews requires looping in a set of experts. We want to conduct API reviews in an agile fashion without randomizing the reviewers or community members. - **Transparency**. We can use the same process for both internal as well as external contributors. This allows contributors to benefit from the results of API reviews even if the implementer isnt external. ## Overall Process  GitHub is generally based around the pull-request model. The idea is that contributors perform their changes in their own fork and submit a pull request against our repository.  For trivial code changes, such as typo fixes, we want folks to directly submit a pull request rather than opening an issue. However, for bug fixes or feature work, we want contributors to first start a discussion by creating an issue.  For work that involves adding new APIs we'd like the issue to contain what we call a _speclet_. The speclet should provide a rough sketch of how the APIs are intended to be used, with sample code that shows typical scenarios. The goal isn't to be complete but rather to illustrate the direction so that readers can judge whether the proposal is sound.  ![Process diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5169960/5499091/a6895e2c-86dd-11e4-8b0e-6ba1ae152541.png) ## Steps - **Contributor opens an issue**. The issue description should contain a speclet that represents a sketch of the new APIs, including samples on how the APIs are being used. The goal isnt to get a complete API list, but a good handle on how the new APIs would roughly look like and in what scenarios they are being used. - **Community discusses the proposal**. If changes are necessary, the contributor is encouraged to edit the issue description. This allows folks joining later to understand the most recent proposal. To avoid confusion, the contributor should maintain a tiny change log, like a bolded Updates: followed by a bullet point list of the updates that were being made. - **Issue is tagged as Accepting PRs**. Once the contributor and project owner agree on the overall shape and direction, the project owner tags the issue as Accepting PRs. The contributor should indicate whether they will be providing the PR or only contributed the idea. - **Coding**. The contributor is implementing the APIs as discussed. Minor deviations are OK, but if during the implementation the design starts to take a major shift, the contributor is encouraged to go back to the issue and raise the concerns with the current proposal. - **Pull request is being created**. Once the contributor believes the implementation is ready for review, she creates a pull request, referencing the issue created in the first step. - **Pull request is being reviewed**. The community reviews the code for the pull request. The review should focus on the code changes and architecture  not the APIs themselves. Once at least two project owners give their OK, the PR is considered good to go. - **Pull is tagged as Needs API Review**. The project owner then marks the pull request as Needs API Review. - **API review**. Using the information in the pull request well create an APIX file that constitutes the API delta. The API review board meets multiple times a week to review all PRs that are tagged as needing an API review. - **Pull request is updated with the results of the API Review**. Once the API review is complete, the project owner uploads the notes and API HTML diff, including all comments. The project owner also updates the PR accordingly, with either a call to action to address some concerns or a good to go indicator. - **Pull request is merged**. When there are no issues  or the issues were addressed by the contributor, the PR is merged. ## API Design Guidelines  The .NET design guidelines are captured in the famous book [Framework Design Guidelines](http://amazon.com/dp/0321545613) by Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams.  A digest with the most important guidelines are available in our [developer wiki](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Framework%20Design%20Guidelines%20Digest). Long term, we'd like to publish the individual guidelines in standalone repo on which we can also accept PRs and -- more importantly for API reviews -- link to. 
295	area-System.Diagnostics	Fix file name casing in System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo.csproj	The file on disk is called Interop.manual.cs, not Interop.Manual.cs. This fixes compilation with Mono on Linux (or other case-sensitive FS).

301	area-System.Diagnostics	FileVersionInfo Cleanup	This addresses code review feedback from #274.  /cc @mellinoe and @stephentoub 
304	area-System.Text	Regex should provide a validation method	"`Regex` doesn't provide a way to validate whether a given string is a valid regular expression without getting an exception. It should provide one. ## Background  `TryParse` is a common pattern in .NET which is useful when a potentially invalid string has to be converted to a different representation. As invalid user input is not an exceptional situation, it makes sense to avoid exception overhead (which coincidentally also educates new developers to handle those situations correctly).  Regular expressions are not as common in external input as `int` or `DateTime`, however there are situations when regex is an appropriate tool for the power users (e.g. advanced text editor search/replace). If you want to validate the regex as it is being typed (with reasonable throttling), it is useful to have as little overhead as possible.  Request for Regex.TryParse (not by me) had [5 votes on Microsoft Connect](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KV6wcz2SJ44J:https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/331753/regex-should-have-a-static-tryparse-method+) and currently exists on [UserVoice with 3 votes](http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2683916-regex-should-have-a-static-tryparse-method). ## Design Options  Originally I wanted to propose `Regex.TryCreate` (which is in line with `Uri.TryCreate` since `Regex` does no have a `Parse` method). However even for power users regexes might not be easy to write, and providing more information than just ""you have failed"" is useful.  I can't think of any existing pattern in the BCL that fits this well, but basically something like this would be useful:  ``` csharp public class Regex {     // existing members     public static RegexParseResult Parse(string pattern);     public static RegexParseResult Parse(string pattern, RegexOptions options);     // or alternatively we could use a default value for options }  public class RegexParseResult {     public bool IsSuccess { get; }     public Regex Regex { get; }     // parser doesn't have to provide more than one, however it would allow it to do so in the future     public IReadOnlyCollection<RegexParseError> Errors { get; } }  public class RegexParseError {     public string Message { get; }     public int Start { get; }     public int End { get; } } ``` ### API Concerns  It would be useful to know if I am missing some existing common pattern here, so that consistency with other BCL APIs can be provided. I don't like using name `Parse` here either as it invites confusion -- however I can't currently think of a better approach. ## Example Usage  ``` csharp public class RegexValidationRule : System.Windows.Controls.ValidationRule {     public override ValidationResult Validate(object value, CultureInfo cultureInfo) {         var valueString = (string)value;         var parseResult = Regex.Parse(valueString);         if (!parseResult.IsSuccess) {             var errorString = string.Join(NewLine, parseResult.Errors.Select(e => $""{e.Message} at {e.Start}""));             return new ValidationResult(false, errorString);         }          return ValidationResult.ValidResult;     } } ``` ## Compatibility  I think adding a new static method should be safe enough.

306	area-System.Diagnostics	Make Process.Start have a option to change handle inheritance	"Currently if you call Process.Start internally CreateProcess is called with bInheritHandles = true (hard coded). It would be great to make it possible to change this behavior, e.g. by adding a Property to ProcessStartInfo.  Currently there is no way I know of to change this other then reimplementing System.Diagnostics.Process. # Example  If you run this application twice without exiting the first notepad instance the second instance will not be able to open the tcp port, because notepad is still running. This can be a problem for server applications that are starting child processes themself and crash, or are killed by the user before the socket can be closed.  ``` csharp using System.Diagnostics; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets;  class Program {     static void Main()     {         TcpListener listener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, 4567);         listener.Start();          Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo(""notepad.exe"") { UseShellExecute = false });         //Simulate application crash without freeing resources     } } ``` # Design proposal  The easiest way to make this possible is to add a new Property to ProcessStartInfo and use this in the Call to CreateProcess  ``` csharp public sealed class ProcessStartInfo { // ...     public bool InheritHandles { get; set; } // defaults to true // ... } ``` # Questions - Is there a very important reason why this was hardcoded like this in the first place?

307	area-Meta	Is the corefx repo or the dotnet org a good place for key community projects?	Forked from #294.  from @n8ohu -   > I am working on uses a C# wrapper around a cross-platform C library and it would, in my opinion, be  beneficial to other developers if it was part of the core;  There is really a spectrum of .NET libraries, with one end point being the official corefx distribution and the other a weekend project never to be touched again. What you are proposing is much closer to the former. I think your base question is whether corefx or a peer repo is appropriate for key community-owned projects. Your scenario is C# wrappers over native libraries, but it could also be a pure managed library, too.  We are considering a similar plan for our own libraries that don't fit or don't fit yet in corefx. We can and should include community libraries in that thinking. The Mono org seems to embrace community libraries that have broad applicability. We should take some inspiration from that.  It's always a fine idea to host a library out of your own GitHub account. At the same time, we are intending the dotnet org to be a center of gravity for .NET library development. That's why we put the corefx repo there (and same will be true for the coreclr one) instead of the Microsoft org. It's likely the case that discoverability will be better in the dotnet org than an arbitrary personal repo.  What do you think?

312	area-System.IO	FileSystem cross platformness and testability	Building cross platform applications that talk to the file system is painful. There are several issues like case sensitivity, slash differences and other bizarre restrictions and differences.  On another front, testability of the file system has always been impossible with .NET. Any application/library that uses the FileSystem uses something like https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IO.Abstractions or a custom abstraction to allow mockability.    Are there any plans to improve the System.IO API to solve some of these problems?

316	area-System.Text	Implement IList<T>, IReadOnlyList<T>, and IList on Regex Collections	Fixes #271  This is still a work-in-progress. ### TODO - [x] Implement `IList<T>`, `IReadOnlyList<T>`, and `IList` - [x] Add `RegexCollectionDebuggerProxy` - [x] API review - [x] Changes based on API review and initial code review feedback - [ ] Cleanup - [ ] Add tests - [ ] Final code review ### Questions/Notes - As @sharwell noted in #277: `GroupEnumerator` is internal, so it might be possible to change the type of `GroupEnumerator.Capture` from `Capture` to `Group`. This would make the explicit cast in the generic `Current` property unnecessary.

321	area-System.Text	Regex capture, match and group collections now implement the generic IEnumerable	This is my first contribution to the .NET Core. I would like to know whether this change would be acceptable under the guidelines of the .NET framework. I am asking because I am making classes implement an interface (acceptable by your rules), but I am also changing the existing interface implementation to an explicit one, in favor of the implicit implementation being the new interface (which is a really grey area that is not included in the rules).  Please guide me as to how this pull request needs to change to become acceptable. 
322	area-Meta	Branching (or not)	While commenting on [an outstanding pull request](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/110#issuecomment-65910391), David Kean mentioned:  > We're trying to figure out our branching structure at the moment. Currently we have only a single branch that represents what we're shipping for the next update of .NET Core. Clearly this isn't scalable for the product, and we're going to creating branches for future work so PR's that have API changes and destablizing changes get a little more bake time. @joshfree is looking into that.  I would like to get the conversation about branching structure out into the open. And to do that, I would like to start by asking: _why_ is a single branch not scalable for the product?  I have worked in code bases of various sizes, release schedules, and branching schemes, and my experience is that NOT branching is nearly always preferable to branching. In fact, the most common reasons given for wanting to branch (e.g. disruptive or long-running changes) are exactly the times when branching hurts the most, because it encourages divergence between different works-in-progress, pushing difficult integration decisions farther out and requiring more rework later.  Rather than a policy that handles change by branching, I would rather see a policy of trunk-based development that encourages all changes - even incomplete changes - to be merged into master on a frequent basis. This shortens and simplifies the merging process and encourages small refactorings and improvements by reducing the amount of work needed to merge them.  Obviously allowing unfinished work to be committed to master requires mechanisms in place to ensure that such work does not affect the releasability of the framework. Mechanisms such as feature flags and branch by abstraction are slightly more complicated to implement in a framework (especially one that is highly tuned for performance) than in a typical application, but not excessively so. And the advantage of keeping all of the ongoing work together is well worth the effort.  What are the community's thoughts on trunk-based development?

325	area-System.Numerics	StringBuilder append with single length strings changed to chars	Some StringBuilder.Append calls made with single length symbol strings. These can be a char so that they get directly assigned to the internal char array buffer. Also more consistent with other areas of the codebase. 
326	area-Meta	.NET Core and pattern compatability	(@terrajobst rightly [pointed out](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/271#issuecomment-68022859) that the thread on implementing collection interfaces on Regex classes had wandered into abstract discussion not related to the original issue. So I am opening this issue in order to continue the discussion here.)  To summarize my point (see the [Regex thread](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/271) for more details): with the addition of IReadOnlyList in .NET 4.5, I don't believe it is appropriate to continue implementing mutable collection interfaces such as IList<T> on immutable collections. The fact that existing immutable collections (including those in the Immutable Collections library) implement these interfaces is not a good enough reason to continue this flawed pattern.  This issue is a particular example of the larger question of how .NET Core will evolve, and how much tolerance it has to evolve _away_ from flawed patterns in the .NET Framework.

338	area-System.Text	RegexCharClass Improvements and Cleanup	Apologies in advance for the large pull request. Normally, I'd break these changes up into separate smaller pull requests, but in this case the changes were all to the same file and some changes build on top of earlier changes, so it was easier to submit as one larger pull request.  Each commit is factored appropriately, so it may be easiest to review each commit separately for more sane diffs.  The most significant change was to precompute the constants instead of computing the values at runtime in the static constructor. I have a [one-off test](https://gist.github.com/justinvp/0c1b5faf72349b56a2ed) (not intended to be checked-in) that asserts that the precomputed values from the new implementation are equal to the values that would have been computed at runtime using the previous implementation.

344	area-System.Security	Support for Rfc2898DeriveBytes and other founding cryptographic support	Hi, Reading the contribution DOs and DON'TS it says not to file an API addition without discussing first. I have the System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes essentially created in a PCL so works in WinRT etc. I'd like to expand on this as Rfc2898DeriveBytes is HmacSha1 based and people are trying to move onto hmacsha256 and upwards nowadays and I'd like to bring this into .NET Core  I'd like to start bringing in System.Security.Cryptography namespace into .NET Core. I'll include tests from the test data listed with the cryptographic standards and whatnot where possible.  Can I do this? :) 
348	area-Meta	Updated README.md with recently added projects	
349	area-System.Threading	TaskHelpers cleanup	TaskHelpers.cs is a temporary stop-gap for assemblies that don't yet depend on the latest System.Threading.Tasks contract. This change removes the dependency on the file for those assemblies that do use the latest, changing them to access the Task.CompletedTask, Task.FromCanceled, and Task.FromException members on Task instead of the corresponding workarounds on TaskHelpers.  This file should eventually go away entirely. 
350	area-System.Console	Use StringBuilderCache in additional assemblies	"StringBuilderCache maintains a cache of up to a single StringBuilder per thread, avoiding StringBuilder allocations for the common pattern of:  ``` C#     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();     // ... do some appends     return sb.ToString(); ```  and instead enabling:  ``` C#     StringBuilder sb = StringBuilderCache.Acquire();     // ... do some appends     return StringBuilderCache.GetStringAndRelease(sb); ```  It was added to the repo as part of System.IO.FileSystem.  This change deploys usage of it through other assemblies.  Not all ""new StringBuilder(...)"" usage has been replaced, just those instances that are expected to be most impactful, e.g. tests were ignored, places where StringBuilders are stored into fields were ignored, debug code was ignored, less common members were ignored, etc.  Simple microbenchmarks showed measurable improvements as a result.  For example, a test around Regex.Replace showed that ~10% of the allocations incurred were for StringBuilder instances; using StringBuilderCache mostly eliminated these and improved throughput by a corresponding ~10%.  This will of course vary based on the test employed, but it's a data point. "
352	area-Meta	Design document for performance patterns	As noted in #351, some patterns which are commonly used in the .NET Framework for performance reasons are not obvious to users who are new to this project. Due to the number of projects which leverage the .NET library as part of their own applications, performance is a particularly sensitive area, especially in regards to [unnecessary] memory allocations. It would be very helpful to have a document explaining commonly used patterns intended to avoid unnecessary memory allocations, and perhaps other techniques which your prior work has indicated are high-value practices for some reason. 
361	area-System.Net	Ability to set the HttpWebRequest.DefaultMaximumErrorResponseLength on a per request basis	I realize the http code hasn't been imported yet.. But it would be really nice if this could be changed in >=4.6  Currently the only way you can set the DefaultMaximumErrorResponseLength for a request is AppDomain wide. We should also be able to be set on a per request basis (like we can do with ServicePoint).

371	area-System.IO	Unix Interop Code is platform specific	In commits like this:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commit/377dde76c5df105a7bab2c0a3002c0d835ff1b07  An attempt has been made to map both structures and constants to C# managed structures.    Unix does not have a binary interface for either the constants or the structures, so the definition is likely already wrong for some platforms and will likely be wrong for ports, even within Linux itself.  While the structures are constants do change from Unix to Unix a little known quirk is that both structures and constants also change in size, layout and the values in Linux itself.  Early versions of Linux chose to emulate the ABI of the host platform, allowing early Linux to easily execute binaries written for the mainstream operating system of the platform.   Linux/Alpha copied OSF/1; Linux/SPARC copied SunOS 4; Linux/MIPS some variation of IRIX and so on.  This is why Linux includes many of these definitions in /usr/include/arch/XXX, because they are different in each platform.  You should do something similar to what Mono.Posix does, which is to have a managed wrapper that talks to a C library that actually performs the native call and marshals the native version to a well-known structure shared with the managed implementation. 
377	area-System.Text	Regex tests intermittently fail due to memory usage	"In RegexLangElementsCoverageTests.cs, there are several checks related to the total memory usage of the test:  ``` CSharp // ** RegexLangElementsCoverageTests.cs **  double maxAcceptablePercentDifference = .3; startWorkingSet = GC.GetTotalMemory(true); ... endWorkingSet = GC.GetTotalMemory(true);  percentDifference = ((double)Math.Abs(startWorkingSet - endWorkingSet)) / startWorkingSet;  if (maxAcceptablePercentDifference < percentDifference) {     Console.WriteLine(""Err_004888anied Total memory increased significantly there may be a memory leak"");     Console.WriteLine(""Percent Difference={0}, Max Acceptable Percent Difference={1}, Start Working Set={2}, End Working Set={3}"",         percentDifference, maxAcceptablePercentDifference, startWorkingSet, endWorkingSet);     iCountErrors++; } ```  I think this check may be causing us more bad than good. I'm not sure what GC.GetTotalMemory takes into consideration, but this logic might also be getting tripped up by the fact that we have multiple tests running in parallel. Also, in general, this seems like a bit of a flaky check in the first place; it fails around 10% of the time for me, I would say. Anyone opposed to removing these checks, or at least making it not an error? "

384	area-System.Collections	Application of ObsoleteAttribute to legacy collection types	As mentioned in #370, the lack of `[Obsolete]` on certain legacy types in `System.Collections.Specialized` could be confusing to developers. In general I support the use of ObsoleteAttribute, but for this particular library I would recommend it only be applied to types which have well-known newer (better) alternatives.  I'm working on the following table...  | Legacy Type | Replacement | | --- | --- | | `BitVector32` | No direct replacement? | | `HybridDictionary` | No direct replacement? | | `IOrderedDictionary` | No direct replacement? | | `ListDictionary` | No direct replacement? | | `NameObjectCollectionBase` | No direct replacement? | | `NameValueCollection` | No direct replacement? | | `OrderedDictionary` | No direct replacement? | | `StringCollection` | `List<string>` | | `StringEnumerator` | Only used with `StringCollection` (not marked obsolete?) | | `StringDictionary` | `Dictionary<string, string>` |

391	area-Meta	Language or BCL data types	"I'm not sure it's worth to discuss this issue. To ensure consistency within the code base the preferred data types should be noted in the wiki.

392	area-Meta	Update Wiki to mention that changes to .NET Core must be binary compatible with the full .NET Framework	A question came up in the comments for #271 about the possibility of a binary breaking change in the .NET Core Regex collections from the Regex collections in the full .NET Framework.  @davkean responded:  > You need to be able to build against this library and run on .NET Framework 4.6.  And I asked:  > So if you accept this suggestion (adding the generic interfaces to these types), the changes will have to be added to .NET 4.6 as well? How much time is left to make changes to .NET 4.6?  And @weshaggard responded:  > Yes @justinvp any types that already exist on the full desktop framework will need to be updated there as well if they are updated in .NET Core. We have a high level goal of making code written for .NET work no matter what .NET platform you are targeting. As for how much time is left to add new public APIs to .NET 4.6 at this point we are not accepting any more unless they are critical. >  > With that said we fully expect .NET Core to evolve much more quickly then the full .NET framework that ships in Windows. We just have to be aware that any changes need to eventually make it there as well so while thinking about breaking changes you cannot just consider .NET Core you must consider the other platforms as well. If we don't do that then we risk diverging the platforms and making .NET development as a whole more difficult.  I think it'd be worth adding this to one of the wiki pages so it is clear to everyone that types in .NET Core that exist in the full .NET Framework must be binary compatible. I don't think this is explicitly stated anywhere currently. 
395	area-System.Runtime	String comparer for sorting numeric strings logically	"## Rationale    For sorting purposes it's common to need portions of strings containing numbers to be treated like numbers. Consider the list of strings `""Windows 7"", ""Windows 10""`.    Using the `Ordinal` `StringComparer` to sort the list one would get    ```  Windows 10  Windows 7  ```    but the desired ascending logical sort would be    ```  Windows 7  Windows 10  ```    ## Proposed API    ```diff   namespace System {       public class StringComparer {  +        public static StringComparer Create(CultureInfo culture, CompareOptions options);       }   }   namespace System.Globalization {       public enum CompareOptions {  +        NumericOrdering = 0x00000020       }   }  ```    ## Usage    ```cs  var list = new List<string> { ""Windows 10"", ""Windows 7"" };  list.Sort(StringComparer.Logical); // List is now ""Windows 7"", ""Windows 10""  ```    This would also be good for sorting strings containing IP addresses.    ## Details    * `Logical` is a convenience property equivalent to the result of `Create(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, CompareOptions.Logical)`  * `LogicalIgnoreCase` is a convenience property equivalent to the result of `Create(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, CompareOptions.Logical | CompareOptions.IgnoreCase)`  * Non-numeric sequences will be evaluated with the culture provided.  * Numeric sequences will be determined by the result of `Char.IsDigit`.  * All UTF-16 digits will be supported and are manually parsed using `Char.GetNumericValue`.  * Only positive integral values without digit separators will be supported directly.  * Numbers will be treated as `ulong`s. Logic for overflows will have to be considered.  * The string `Windows 8.1` would be considered 4 sequences. The `Windows ` would be a string sequence, the `8` would be a numeric sequence, the `.` would be another string sequence, and the `1` would be another numeric sequence.  * This API could later be expanded to include support for allowing signs, decimals, and digit separators through the use of overloads accepting a `NumberStyles` parameter.  * When a numeric and string sequence are considered at the same time the numeric sequence always comes before the string sequence so when sorting the following list, `""a"", ""7""` the number `7` will be sorted before the letter `a`.  * Existing methods that take a `CompareOptions` parameter as input will need to be updated to support the new `Logical` member.    ## Open Questions    * Should `CompareOptions.Logical` be implemented as the flag option `SORT_DIGITSASNUMBERS` to the `dwCmpFlags` parameter of [`CompareStringEx`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317761(v=vs.85).aspx)? Using it's implementation should be more efficient but later expanding support for `NumberStyles` will require a re-implementation with matching behavior.    ## Updates    * Added `Logical` and `LogicalIgnoreCase` properties.  * Added support for all UTF-16 digits.  * Added more `CreateLogical` overloads to match the `Create` method.  * Added retrieval of the `NumberFormatInfo` from the `StringComparer` parameter when not explicitly provided and is a `CultureAwareComparer`.  * Removed `CreateLogical` overloads that matched the `Create` method.  * Switched to only supporting positive integral values without digit separators.  * Added consideration of comparing a numeric sequence with a string sequence.  * Added the flag member `CompareOptions.Logical` and changed `CreateLogical` to be just an overload of `Create`."

461	area-System.Collections	Add a static Shuffle method to Array and an instance method to List<T>	Consider adding a static Shuffle method to Array and an instance method to List<T> ## Motivation  Shuffling data is often required in various applications. .NET does not contain a method to shuffle an array which results in many people implementing it themselves. Implementing a Shuffle method is not really hard but it does require like 10 lines of code and people often wonder where to put these so they just prefer quick and dirty solutions like abusing sort methods with random sort key or even worse random comparison. These methods are far from ideal both because they depend on implementation details of the sorting methods and because they are less effective than the ideal O(N) implementation. ## Proposed API  Methods on Array:  ``` C# public static void Shuffle<T>(T[] array) public static void Shuffle<T>(T[] array, int index, int length) public static void Shuffle<T>(T[] array, Random rng) public static void Shuffle<T>(T[] array, int index, int length, Random rng) ```  Methods on List<T>  ``` C# public void Shuffle() public void Shuffle(Random rng) ``` ## Details  The Shuffle method on Array has an overload that can be used to shuffle just part of the array. This is in line with existing Array methods like Sort and Copy and can be useful when implementing Shuffle on List<T> where only the elements of the List will be shuffled without shuffling the full capacity of the list. I also suggest adding an instance Shuffle method on List<T> since this is the most common usage of such a method.

467	area-System.Runtime	Add a Clamp method to System.Math	I know the `System.Math` library hasn't been pushed to the .Net Core library but since discussing api additions could take some time I thought it was a good idea to propose it now. # Rationale and Usage  `Math.Clamp` is an easy to implement method and makes it easier for developers. Currently developers would have to implement their own methods in an extension class or use `Math.Max` and `Math.Min` together. The proposed API will shorten the amount of code needed and increase readability.  Two examples on how we currently can clamp in .NET:  ``` C# int result = Math.Max(Math.Min(value, 100), 0); ```  ``` C# public static class Ext {     // Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2683487/1455541     public static T Clamp<T>(T val, T min, T max) where T : IComparable<T>     {         if (val.CompareTo(min) < 0) return min;         else if(val.CompareTo(max) > 0) return max;         else return val;     } } // Somewhere in the codebase int result = Ext.Clamp(value, 0, 100); ```  The proposed API would turn that into:  ``` C# int result = Math.Clamp(value, 0, 100); ``` # Proposed API 1 - Specialized  ``` C# public static class Math {      public static Byte Clamp(Byte value, Byte min, Byte max);     public static Decimal Clamp(Decimal value, Decimal min, Decimal max);     public static Double Clamp(Double value, Double min, Double max);     public static Int16 Clamp(Int16 value, Int16 min, Int16 max);     public static Int32 Clamp(Int32 value, Int32 min, Int32 max);     public static Int64 Clamp(Int64 value, Int64 min, Int64 max);     public static SByte Clamp(SByte value, SByte min, SByte max);     public static Single Clamp(Single value, Single min, Single max);     public static UInt16 Clamp(UInt16 value, UInt16 min, UInt16 max);     public static UInt32 Clamp(UInt32 value, UInt32 min, UInt32 max);     public static UInt64 Clamp(UInt64 value, UInt64 min, UInt64 max);  } ```  This proposed version mimics the way current `System.Math` methods do it. # Proposed API 2 - IComparable<T>  Because this is a new API addition it can also be possible to have smaller implementation  using generics that should cover all the cases.  ``` C# public static class Math {      public static T Clamp<T>(T value, T min, T max)  where T : System.IComparable<T>;  } ``` # Open Questions - If the api addition is going to be implemented should it be implemented as Proposed API 1 or 2?

470	area-Meta	Do not use optional arguments on public APIs	As part of the [discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/apireviews/tree/master/2015-01-14-misc#110-add-async-documentelement-loading-for-xlinq) around adding async document/element loading for XLINQ (#110) it was mentioned using optional arguments (commonly called optional parameters).  **PLEASE, DON'T USE IT ON PUBLIC APIS!!!**  Before there were optional arguments the problem of a large number of possible parameters for an API already existed. And since we are talking about XML, look at how `XmlReader` and `XmlWritter` solved it: - [public static XmlReader Create(TextReader input, XmlReaderSettings settings)](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Xml/System/Xml/Core/XmlReader.cs,6375d7745e42dee9) - [public static XmlWriter Create(XmlWriter output, XmlWriterSettings settings)](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Xml/a.html#c6b2420e91f21e33)  Taking advantage of object initialization, calling it looks like optional arguments:  ``` XmlReader.Create(reader, new XmlReaderSettings{ IgnoreWhitespace = true }); ```  (I'm going to propose more type inference for cases like this: [Do not require type specification for constructors when the type is known #35](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/35))  It's extensible. Another setting can always be added with proper defaults and without breaking existing code.  And those settings also become something that can be passed around.  Imagine that the original API used optional arguments and there was only one `Save` method. How would you keep that and now add an `CancellationToken` parameter?

489	area-System.Numerics	Add primitive structs Rectangle and Point	System.Drawing, System.Windows, and XNA all implement nearly-identical structures to represent points and rectangles.   Given the verbosity of a correct implementation, many library developers re-use an existing implementation, and tie their public APIs to (non-core-compatible) dependencies.   Offering primitives like Point, Rectangle (as well as PointF, RectangleF, and Color) would make it much easier for libraries to be compatible with each other.   Or, is there a de-facto standard nuget package for these structs that we can promote? 
490	area-System.Runtime	Allow the Math methods to return float values	I find myself casting returned results from Math methods into floats constantly, even if only floats are supplied as parameters for that method. Many developers don't need the accuracy of a double and floats works fine, many other numeric structs store their values are floats too (such as a Vector2). While explicit casting doesn't hurt anyone there are other classes I have come by that return a float if the supplied parameter(s) is float only.  This wouldn't really be considered a new API addition, all it would do is add overloaded methods that accepts floats as parameters and returns a float (could call the Double version of the Method underneath to avoid code duplication and cast back). If any of the parameters become a double then the double version of the Method would be called and a double value would return.  I would like feedback on what other people think before implementing it. 
492	area-System.Collections	statistic distribution generator	I am thinking to add some random generators that obeys specific statistic distribution functions (like normal, binomial, geometric and so on) and also makes the random generator usable as IEnumerable to be easier to use in line or sequence expressions. There is a great paper that covers the ability to obtain sampling functions by composing other sampling functions that is quite nice to express via IEnumerable and IEnumerator. Suck functions can be very useful to obtain numbers that follow a specific law, for example to be used in generating correct weights to initialise untrained neural networks or similar scenarios. 
494	area-System.Runtime	Consider exposing extension methods for System.Array .Net 2 convenience methods	With .net 2.0, `System.Array` was given a set of convenient LINQ like methods like those present on `List<T>`. Unlike `List<T>`, they were added as static methods.  While, LINQ does offer some of these methods these variants do offer some differences/benefits as they are A: Optimized for arrays. B: Evaluated immediately.  C: Always produce an array.  These methods are::  ``` csharp AsReadOnly<T> BinarySearch<T> ConvertAll<T> Exists<T> Find<T> FindAll<T> FindIndex<T> FindLast<T> FindLastIndex<T> ForEach<T> IndexOf<T> LastIndexOf<T> Sort<T> TrueForAll<T> ```  Some of these offer no real benefit over LINQ, but others can be very useful especially in array heavy APIs like Reflection. Primarily `ConvertAll` and `FindAll`. These methods would also make it easier to work with arrays. There would be no clash with existing LINQ methods as they have different names.

497	area-Meta	Remove non-cancellable overloads from async APIs	I'd like to start discussion on removing the convenience overloads that call a cancellable API with `CancellationToken.None`:  `Task DoAsync() {     return DoAsync(CancellationToken.None); }`  I think these overloads bloat the API and if you've got a large number of parameters, can be error-prone to implement.  I also believe they encourage poor design: consider that a great majority of async code either already does or should support cancellation. The use of these APIs should be relatively rare in good code. 
498	area-System.Collections	HashSet<T> constructor performance tuning for ISet<T>	"As it is currently, `HashSet<T>` has a constructor that takes `IEnumerable<T>`.   `var set1 = new HashSet<int>{2,3,4};` `var set2 = new HashSet<int>(set1); // binds against ctor..(IEnumerable<T>)`  This works nicely, but the fact that we are ""copying/cloning"" from `ISet<T>` is not being taken advantange of.   If we have `HashSet<T>` with  ~10000 elements, **there is no efficient way to create a copy of it**. Instead, current implementation will call internally `AddIfNotPresent` for each element in given `IEnumerable<T>`, eg, do an expensive element lookup for each item that is being added (to check if it doesn't exist in our current `HashSet<T>`).  This does not have to be the case. `ISet<T>` already promises us the uniqueness.  Let me know if this is something of interest, I would like to work on that. "
503	area-Meta	Make use of Code Contracts where ever applicable.	I wonder the reason why while the code contracts are part of BCL and it is a research project of Microsoft, only some of the API makes use of it.

525	area-Meta	Consider creating a gitter channel for corefx repo	"I was checking out the Aurelia docs (new JS framework), and they casually mention ""If you have questions, we hope that you will join us on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Aurelia/Discuss).""  Gitter is apparently a free group chat for open source projects hosted on github. Here's the best ""About"" page I could find: http://blog.gitter.im/about/. It looks like they have really good github integration (an activity feed that shows PRs; issues; commits; etc).  I'd be really interested in trying out a gitter channel for the corefx repo. "
526	area-System.Collections	Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class should allow to use a custom load factor	Hello guys,  I had seen the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class does not allow the use of a custom `load factor`, this may allow many optimizations, as the case we want to create a dictionary of known initial size and it will be completely filled, but we don't want that resizing operations occurs, for example it would be possible setting the `load factor` to `1.0F`.  The class constructors below may be added:  ``` csharp public Dictionary(int capacity, float loadFactor); public Dictionary(int capacity, float loadFactor, IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer) ```  Simirlarly to `Java`'s `HashMap<K, V>` class constructor:  ``` java public HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor); ```  When the `load factor` is not known, it should take a default value, for example `0.75F`.  Thanks a lot :smile: and excuse me for any inconvenience. 
529	area-Infrastructure	Clean target removes dependencies	"The ""Clean"" target of the build script intentionally removes the ""src\packages"" directory, causing the next build to have to restore them again. This is unnecessary, and atypical compared to most build scripts. ""Clean"" typically removes the outputs of the build process, not the inputs.  If there is a need for an ability to wipe out the packages directory, I propose putting this functionality under a separate target, ""CleanDependencies"". "
537	area-System.Globalization	Refactor globalization extensions with PAL	Simple refactoring to introduce a PAL layer into System.Globalization.Extensions.  Cleaned up a few things along the way as well, e.g. factoring out some duplicated code into helpers, making a few fields readonly, etc. 
538	area-System.Runtime	New API proposal: null replacement with Option, Some and None	"The .NET framework and C# have implemented a lot of ideas of functional programming. LINQ, lambdas and immutability are only a few examples. In my eyes this makes the real difference between Java and .NET Solving the [null reference problem](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare) would be the next great addition to the .NET framework borrowed from functional languages.  So in this issue I want to propose the addition of a [Option type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type) to the .NET Framework.  # Background  Taken from https://github.com/louthy/language-ext#null-reference-problem:  > null must be the biggest mistake in the whole of computer language history. I realise the original designers of C# had to make pragmatic decisions, it's a shame this one slipped through though. So, what to do about the 'null problem'? >  > null is often used to indicate 'no value'. i.e. the method called can't produce a value of the type it said it was going to produce, and therefore it gives you 'no value'. The thing is that when 'no value' is passed to the consuming code, it gets assigned to a variable of type T, the same type that the function said it was going to return, except this variable now has a timebomb in it. You must continually check if the value is null, if it's passed around it must be checked too.  >  > Option works in a very similar way to Nullable except it works with all types rather than just value types. It's a struct and therefore can't be null. An instance can be created by either calling Some(value), which represents a positive 'I have a value' response; Or None, which is the equivalent of returning null. >  > So why is it any better than returning T and using null? It seems we can have a non-value response again right? Yes, that's true, however you're forced to acknowledge that fact, and write code to handle both possible outcomes because you can't get to the underlying value without acknowledging the possibility of the two states that the value could be in. This bulletproofs your code. You're also explicitly telling any other programmers that: ""This method might not return a value, make sure you deal with that"". This explicit declaration is very powerful. # Rationale and Usage  So basically the `Option` type enforces developers to check if a return value has really a value.   An example function returning an option would be something like this:  ``` public Option<string> GetCacheValue(string key)  {     if(cache.Keys.Contains(key))     {         return cache[key];         //return new Some(cache[key])          //return new Option<string>(cache[key]);     }     else      {         return Option<string>.None;         //return new Option<string>();     } } ```  The consumer code would then look like this:  ``` string value = GetCacheValue(key).Match(     some: v => v,     none: () => ""this is the default value"" ) ``` # Proposed API  ``` public struct Option<T> {     // For creating a None     public Option();     public Option(T value)       public static readonly Option<T> None = new Option<T>();      public bool IsNone {get; };     public bool IsSome { get; }       public static implicit operator Option<T>(T value)     public static implicit operator Option<T>(OptionNone none)     public TReturn Match(Func<T, TReturn> some, Func<TReturn> none);     public static Option<T> Some(T value); } ``` # Details - This was mainly inspired by https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/blob/master/LanguageExt.Core/Option.cs of @louthy # Open questions - [ ] Should there be a public `Value` property as an alternative to Match? - [ ] In which assembly would this be correct? Namespace?  - [ ] Should Option be a struct (security, since it cannot be null) or an interface (usability, since `Option<string>` is then also an `Option<object>`)?  Thoughts?  "
539	area-Meta	Improve flow of readme	Changed the ordering of content and a few pieces of wording. Primary goal was to pop contributing opportunities as early as possible in the readme, since the components list is getting quite long. We may want to do something different with the list as it grows even longer, but we'll not worry about that now. 
540	area-System.Xml	Remove double type checks in System.Xml	Replace code like this:  ```  if (obj is Foo)      ((Foo)obj).DoSomething(); ```  with  ``` Foo foo = obj as Foo; if (foo != null)     foo.DoSomething(); ```  Most of these changes were verified in #491 and #482, but these PRs were reverted due reasons non-related with these changes.

If they are not, we would have to introduce 'handles' of items to enable their update/remove. Or the update/remove semantics would have to apply to first/all, which is weird.    Modeled after [`Queue<T>`](https://apisof.net/catalog/System.Collections.Generic.Queue%3CT%3E) ([MSDN link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7977ey2c(v=vs.110).aspx))    ### API    ```c#  public class PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority>      : IEnumerable,      IEnumerable<(TElement element, TPriority priority)>,      IReadOnlyCollection<(TElement element, TPriority priority)>      // ICollection not included on purpose  {      public PriorityQueue();      public PriorityQueue(IComparer<TPriority> comparer);        public IComparer<TPriority> Comparer { get; }      public int Count { get; }      public bool IsEmpty { get; }        public bool Contains(TElement element);        // Peek & Dequeue      public (TElement element, TPriority priority) Peek(); // Throws if empty      public (TElement element, TPriority priority) Dequeue(); // Throws if empty      public bool TryPeek(out TElement element, out TPriority priority); // Returns false if empty      public bool TryDequeue(out TElement element, out TPriority priority); // Returns false if empty        // Enqueue & Update      public void Enqueue(TElement element, TPriority priority); // Throws if it is duplicate      public void Update(TElement element, TPriority priority); // Throws if element does not exist      public void EnqueueOrUpdate(TElement element, TPriority priority);      public bool TryEnqueue(TElement element, TPriority priority); // Returns false if it is duplicate (does NOT update it)      public bool TryUpdate(TElement element, TPriority priority); // Returns false if element does not exist (does NOT add it)            public void Remove(TElement element); // Throws if element does not exist      public bool TryRemove(TElement element); // Returns false if element does not exist        public void Clear();        public IEnumerator<(TElement element, TPriority priority)> GetEnumerator();      IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator();    //  // Selector part  //      public PriorityQueue(Func<TElement, TPriority> prioritySelector);      public PriorityQueue(Func<TElement, TPriority> prioritySelector, IComparer<TPriority> comparer);        public Func<TElement, TPriority> PrioritySelector { get; }        public void Enqueue(TElement element);      public void Update(TElement element);  }  ````    **Open questions:**  1. Class name `PriorityQueue` vs. `Heap`  2. Introduce `IHeap` and constructor overload? (Should we wait for later?)  3. Introduce `IPriorityQueue`? (Should we wait for later - `IDictionary` example)  4. Use selector (of priority stored inside the value) or not (5 APIs difference)  5. Use tuples `(TElement element, TPriority priority)` vs. `KeyValuePair<TPriority, TElement>`      * Should `Peek` and `Dequeue` rather have `out` argument instead of tuple?  6. Is `Peek` and `Dequeue` throwing useful at all?    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    # Original Proposal    Issue https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/163 requested the addition of a priority queue to the core .NET collection data structures.    This post, while a duplicate, is intended to act the formal submission to the corefx API Review Process. The issue contents are the _speclet_ for a new System.Collections.Generic.PriorityQueue<T> type.    I will be contributing the PR, if approved.  ## Rationale and Usage    The .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL) currently lacks support for ordered producer-consumer collections. A common requirement of many software applications is the ability generate a list of items over time and process them in an order different from the order they were received in.    There are three generic data structures within the System.Collections hierarchy of namespaces that supported a sorted collection of items; System.Collections.Generic.SortedList, System.Collections.Generic.SortedSet, and System.Collections.Generic.SortedDictionary.    Of these, SortedSet and SortedDictionary are not appropriate for producer-consumer patterns that generate duplicate values. The complexity of SortedList is ?(n) worst case for both Add and Remove.    A much more memory and time efficient data structure for ordered collections with producer-consumer usage patterns is a priority queue. Other than when capacity resizing is necessary, worse case insertion (enqueue) and remove top (dequeue) performance is ?(log n) - far better than the existing options that exist in the BCL.    Priority queues have a wide degree of applicability across different classes of applications. The Wikipedia page on Priority Queues offers a list of many different well understand use cases. While highly specialized implementations may still require custom priority queue implementations, a standard implementation would cover a broad range of usage scenarios. Priority queues are particularly useful in scheduling the output of multiple producers, which is an important pattern in highly parallelized software.    It's worth noting that both the C++ standard library and Java offer priority queue functionality as part of their basic APIs.  ## Proposed API    ``` C#  namespace System.Collections.Generic  {      /// <summary>      /// Represents a collection of objects that are removed in a sorted order.      /// </summary>      /// <typeparam name=""T"">Specifies the type of elements in the queue.</typeparam>          [DebuggerDisplay(""Count = {count}"")]      [DebuggerTypeProxy(typeof(System_PriorityQueueDebugView<>))]      public class PriorityQueue<T> : IEnumerable<T>, ICollection, IEnumerable, IReadOnlyCollection<T>      {          /// <summary>          /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=""PriorityQueue{T}""/> class           /// that uses a default comparer.          /// </summary>          public PriorityQueue();

Items with a greater comparison value will be returned first. (descending order)  - Time complexities:    | Operation | Complexity | Notes |  | --- | --- | --- |  | Construct | ?(1) |  |  | Construct Using IEnumerable | ?(n) |  |  | Enqueue | ?(log n) |  |  | Dequeue | ?(log n) |  |  | Peek | ?(1) |  |  | Count | ?(1) |  |  | Clear | ?(N) |  |  | Contains | ?(N) |  |  | CopyTo | ?(N) | Uses Array.Copy, actual complexity may be lower |  | ToArray | ?(N) | Uses Array.Copy, actual complexity may be lower |  | GetEnumerator | ?(1) |  |  | Enumerator.MoveNext | ?(1) |  |  - Additional constructor overloads that take the System.Comparison<T> delegate were intentionally omitted in favor of a simplified API surface area. Callers can use Comparer<T>.Create to convert a function or Lambda expression to an IComparer<T> interface if necessary. This does require the caller to incur a one-time heap allocation.  - Although System.Collections.Generic is not yet part of corefx, I propose that this class be added to corefxlab in the meantime. It can be moved to the primary corefx repository once System.Collections.Generic are added and there is consensus that its status should be elevated from experimental to an official API.  - An IsEmpty property was not included, since there is no additional performance penalty calling Count. The majority of the collection data structures do not include IsEmpty.  - The IsSynchronized and SyncRoot properties of ICollection were implemented explicitly as they are effectively obsolete. This also follows the pattern used for the other System.Collection.Generic data structures.  - Dequeue and Peek throw an InvalidOperationException when the queue is empty to match the established behavior of System.Collections.Queue<T>.  - IProducerConsumerCollection<T> was not implemented as its documentation states that it is only intended for thread-safe collections.  ## Open Questions  - Is avoiding an additional heap allocation during calls to GetEnumerator when using foreach a strong enough rationale for including the nested public enumerator structure?   - Should CopyTo, ToArray, and GetEnumerator return results in prioritized (sorted) order, or the internal order used by the data structure? My assumption is that the internal order should be returned, as it doesn't incur any additional performance penalties. However, this is a potential usability issue if a developer thinks of the class as a ""sorted queue"" rather a priority queue.  - Does adding a type named PriorityQueue to System.Collections.Generic cause a potentially breaking change? The namespace is heavily used, and could cause a source compatibility problem for projects that include their own priority queue type.  - Should items be dequeued in ascending or descending order, based on the output of IComparer<T>? (my assumption is ascending order, to match the normal sorting convention of IComparer<T>).  - Should the collection be 'stable'? In other words, should two items with equal IComparison<T> results be dequeued in the exact same order they are enqueued in? (my assumption is this isn't needed)  ## Updates  - Fixed complexity of 'Construct Using IEnumerable' to ?(n). Thanks @svick.  - Added another option question regarding whether the priority queue should be ordered in ascending or descending order compared to the IComparer<T>.  - Removed NotSupportedException from explicit SyncRoot property to match behavior of other System.Collection.Generic types instead of using the newer pattern.  - Made the public GetEnumerator method return a nested Enumerator struct instead of IEnumerable<T>, similar to the existing System.Collections.Generic types. This is an optimization to avoid a heap (GC) allocation when using a foreach loop.  - Removed ComVisible attribute.  - Changed complexity of Clear to ?(n). Thanks @mbeidler.  "

584	area-System.Linq	ParallelEnumerable.Range(...).AsOrdered().Concat(...) ...out of order	I'm getting a pretty distressing error:  ``` int leftSize = 4; int rightSize = 4; int[] leftData = new int[leftSize]; for (int i = 0; i < leftSize; i++) leftData[i] = i; int[] rightData = new int[rightSize]; for (int i = 0; i < rightSize; i++) rightData[i] = i;  ParallelQuery<int> query = ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, leftSize).AsOrdered().Concat(ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, rightSize));  Assert.True(leftData.Concat(rightData).SequenceEqual(query)); ```  ...fails.  The expected sequence is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, and the actual result of this `Concat(...)` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.  Adding `AsOrdered()` to the inner range has no effect.  There is no history of changes for `Concat(...)`, although the actual problem may be elsewhere.  This issue is **NOT** present in the current .NET distribution (ie, creating a brand-new C# project won't reproduce the error, this is something happening in corefx, which is a really good thing)/  Generating the parallel sequence via `Enumerable.Range(...).AsParallel().AsOrdered()` _also_ fails, but seems to be putting the elements in non-deterministic order (the last run was `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3]`).  However, generating the sequence via `leftData.AsParallel().AsOrdered().Concat(leftData.AsParallel())` returns the expected sequence (both of them have to be generated via backing arrays, or you get the re-ordered or non-deterministic results).  `ParallelEnumerable.Range(...).AsOrdered()` _does_ return an ordered sequence.  The following test succeeds:    ``` int count = 8; ParallelQuery<object> elements = ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, count).AsOrdered().Select(x => (object)x);  int counter = 0; Assert.All(elements.Cast<int>(), x => Assert.Equal(counter++, x)); Assert.Equal(count, counter); ```

This commit fixes all of them (issues #176 and #240), except for #235, which is addressed by a separate PR (#585) for a product bug rather than test issues.  I did not do a general pass through the PLINQ tests, even though they could use it.  PlinqModesTests - There's an explicit comment at the top of the test that it's not meant for DOP==1 (it verifies that work happens in parallel), and then apparently we were surprised when it was failing on single core machines that result in DOP == 1 ;)  UnionIntersectDistinctTests.RunOreredUnionTest1 - There's no reason this test should fail.  If it does, there's a bug to be investigated.  I'm assuming it was actually stalling because of another test running with it concurrently.  WithCancellationTests - A bunch of these tests were scheduling tasks to asynchronously cancel/dispose a query, and the query was written to take a certain amount of time to hopefully allow for cancellation to take place.  But it appears as part of the tests being ported, those timeouts were simply commented out, making it extremely likely the tests would fail.  I've just rewritten them to do the cancellation as part of the query's execution rather than using a separate asynchronous task.  I also deleted some duplicative tests.  And I made some tests that still did explicit delays/timeouts to be OuterLoop. 
594	area-System.Runtime	Parsing string to enum with digit as first char takes a very long time	"Note: This has to do with mscorlib. https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource sent me here, but this doesn't look like the place where this is handled. Am I right?  When parsing strings to enums with TryParse, in some cases this takes way longer than in all the other cases. After a bit of research I found that all the strings with a digit as first char are slower. This is due to the attempt to parse the string to the underlying type (https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/mscorlib/system/enum.cs#L441) with a Convert.ChangeType, which can throw an exception, because further down the line it uses (for example) Int32.Parse instead of TryParse (https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/mscorlib/system/convert.cs#L1121).  The time it takes to create the Exception is significant. In my project I ended up writing a new Enum parser to circumvent this issue. ""Something"": 240.49 ns per parse ""1Somethin"": 37178.57 ns per parse ""123456789"": 485.63 ns per parse  As users expect Convert.ToXxx() to throw an exception when it fails, changing this is a bad idea I think. Possible solutions I can think of: - Extend the Convert class with Try-methods that don't throw exceptions, and use those while trying to parse an enum (much work) - Instead of checking whether the first character is a digit (https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/mscorlib/system/enum.cs#L434), change that line to a TryParse of the whole string (the easier way) "

From @mj1856   I would like to propose that [`DateTime.Now`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/ef1e2ab328087c61a6878c1e84f4fc5d710aebce/src/mscorlib/src/System/DateTime.cs#L904-L920) be deprecated.  This is most developer's first introduction to working with time, and is also a root cause of bugs related to daylight saving time and time zones.  Developers should get in the habit of thinking globally, rather than locally - especially when designing for the web.  Even on desktop and mobile applications that only run in a single time zone, this can create the kind of bugs that pull developers out of bed at 2AM on the morning of a daylight saving time transition.  More supporting arguments: - [The Case Against DateTime.Now](http://www.codeofmatt.com/2013/04/25/the-case-against-datetime-now/) - Matt Johnson (me) - [What's Wrong with DateTime Anyway](http://blog.nodatime.org/2011/08/what-wrong-with-datetime-anyway.html) - Jon Skeet  Given the widespread nature of this API, I suggest _not_ removing it from coreclr - but rather marking it with an `[Obsolete]` attribute.

644	area-System.Reflection	Proposal:  Additional methods to aid in reflection of generic types	"I don't know if this is the appropriate place to make such a suggestion.  ## Problem    I've always found it a bit annoying that the reflection APIs in .NET haven't been improved much since the advent of generics and when working with generic types or methods that considerable additional boilerplate needs to be written in order to correctly work with these types.  ## Solution    In the past I've implemented helper extension methods which significantly simplify reflection over generic types and methods.  These extension methods largely work on top of the public surface of the `System.Type` class, although a few dealing with generic methods did resort to reflection in order to call internal methods to better detect and deal with ambiguities.  I think that it would be very convenient to have these methods (or something like them) considered for addition into the core framework.    I am willing and able to share my extension methods and could start a branch if there is traction to this idea.  ### FindGenericInterfaces    Identical to `Type.FindInterfaces` except that it will match on open generic interface types.    ``` cs  public delegate bool GenericTypeFilter(Type type, Type[] genericArguments, object filterCriteria);    public static Type[] FindGenericInterfaces(this Type type, Type genericInterfaceType);  public static Type[] FindGenericInterfaces(this Type type, Type genericInterfaceType, GenericTypeFilter filter, object filterCriteria);    Type[] interfaces = typeof(int[]).FindGenericInterfaces(typeof(IEnumerable<>), (type, types, criteria) => types[0] == typeof(int), null);  ```  ### ImplementsInterface    Returns `true` if the type implements the specified interface.  The interface can either be an open generic type or a closed constructed type.  If the case of the former the overloads can be used to return the generic type arguments.  For those overloads that accept a specific count of `out` parameters the generic type arguments must match the count of the `out Type` arguments.  For the overload that accepts a `Type[]` the number of generic type arguments must match the length of the array.  The overload that accepts an `out Type[]` will match any number of generic type arguments.    _I also have `IsSubclassOf` and `Is` extension methods that function in almost the same manner except that the first matches if the type is a subclass of the specified type and the second matches if the type is a subclass of, implements or is of the specified type._    ``` cs  public static bool ImplementsInterface(this Type type, Type interfaceType);  public static bool ImplementsInterface(this Type type, Type interfaceType, out Type genericArgument);  public static bool ImplementsInterface(this Type type, Type interfaceType, out Type genericArgument1, out Type genericArgument2);  public static bool ImplementsInterface(this Type type, Type interfaceType, out Type genericArgument1, out Type genericArgument2, out Type genericArgument3);  public static bool ImplementsInterface(this Type type, Type interfaceType, Type[] genericArguments);  public static bool ImplementsInterface(this Type type, Type interfaceType, out Type[] genericArguments);    Type elementType, keyType;  if (typeof(int[]).ImplementsInterface(typeof(IEnumerable<int>)) { ... }  if (typeof(int[]).ImplementsInterface(typeof(IEnumerable<>), out elementType)) { ... }  if (typeof(Dictionary<string, int>).ImplementsInterface(typeof(IDictionary<>), out keyType, out elementType)) { ... }  Type[] arguments = new Type[2];  if (typeof(Dictionary<string, int>).ImplementsInterface(typeof(IDictionary<>), arguments)) { ... }  arguments = null;  if (typeof(Dictionary<string, int>).ImplementsInterface(typeof(IDictionary<>), out arguments)) { ... }  ```  ### GetGenericMethod    _Separated into proposal [Add GetGenericMethod method to simplify finding generic methods via reflection](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/16567)._    Returns the generic method with the same number of specified generic arguments.  The generic arguments are checked for compatibility with the generic type constraints.  If a parameter type list is also specified then the parameter types must be acceptable for the given generic type arguments.    _In order to properly handle matches and ambiguity resolution I did have to break out reflection in order to invoke the internal members `RuntimeType.FilterApplyMethodBase`, `DefaultBinder.FindMostDerivedNewSlotMeth` and `DefaultBinder.CompareMethodSigAndName`.  A built-in implementation would not require to rely on any reflection._    ``` cs  public static MethodInfo GetGenericMethod(this Type type, string name, Type[] genericArgs);  public static MethodInfo GetGenericMethod(this Type type, string name, Type[] genericArgs, BindingFlags bindingAttrs);  public static MethodInfo GetGenericMethod(this Type type, string name, Type[] genericArgs, Type[] types);  public static MethodInfo GetGenericMethod(this Type type, string name, Type[] genericArgs, Type[] types, ParameterModifier[] modifiers);  public static MethodInfo GetGenericMethod(this Type type, string name, Type[] genericArgs, BindingFlags bindingAttrs, Binder binder, Type[] types, ParameterModifier[] modifiers);  public static MethodInfo GetGenericMethod(this Type type, string name, Type[] genericArgs, BindingFlags bindingAttrs, Binder binder, CallingConventions callConvention, Type[] types, ParameterModifier[] modifiers);    public class Foo {      public void Bar(object value) { ... }      public void Bar<T>(T value) { ... }  }    MethodInfo genericBar = typeof(Foo).GetGenericMethod(""Bar"", new Type[] { typeof(string) }, new Type[] { typeof(string) });  ```  "

668	area-System.Runtime	Implement a generic Enum.Parse method	Although the Enum.TryParse method (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.enum.tryparse(v=vs.110).aspx) has two generic overloads, the Enum.Parse overloads (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Enum.Parse(v=vs.110).aspx) were added to the .NET Framework in version 1.0, before the introduction of generics. They create the need for rather redundant code, such as  ``` Colors colorValue = (Colors) Enum.Parse(typeof(Colors), colorString); ```  which entails the need to add an additional cast, as well as instantiate a Type object that represents the enumeration type.  It would be nice to add generic Parse overloads that correspond to the generic TryParse overloads:  ``` public static TEnum Enum.Parse<TEnum>(String value); public static TEnum Enum.Parse<TEnum>(String value, Boolean ignoreCase);   ```  Note that there's also another open issue on improving the performance of Enum.TryParse at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/594.

The next time we need to make a change to these tests, it would also be worth getting the native binaries to build as vcxprojs, relying on the VS2013 prerequisite for now (see [System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.Tests](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/v1.0/src/System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController/tests/System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.Tests) for an example).  When we start to light up tests cross-platform, we will be forced to clean this up and use CMake or some other solution for native binaries.  cc @weshaggard  
679	area-Infrastructure	Refactor build to run tests based on targets and dependencies rather than properties	"The build system currently runs tests by setting the RunTestsForProject to execute after PrepareForRun. Because we don't want to run the tests after a Visual Studio build (because VS has its own mechanisms for running tests), since #508 the BuildingInsideVisualStudio property is used to disable the RunTestsForProject target.  Making the build system aware of the context in which its running in order to skip a target feels odd in a build system with a robust target and dependency mechanism. It seems to me that it would be more idiomatic for the build to expose its targets in such a way so that each context can use the target system to control what targets are run. In other words, do not include the RunTestsForProject in the dependency tree of the default target for the sub-project files (which is what Visual Studio will execute), but do include it in the dependency tree of the default target for the top-level build file.  In practice, I believe this would just mean changing the default target for each sub-project to be Compile instead of Build.  This would also have the positive effect of making the build IDE-agnostic, which is important as .NET Core becomes truly cross-platform. What would the value of the ""BuildingInsideVisualStudio"" property be from within Xamarin Studio, or SharpDevelop, or Sublime using [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/)? Xamarin Studio actually sets BuildingInVisualStudio to true in order to try and increase compatibility, which is obviously not a desirable state of affairs. Let's try to reduce the need for such hacks by keeping the dependencies between the build and the IDE clean (i.e. one-way). "

684	area-System.Runtime	Add non-throwing methods to Convert class	"Convert class is the only method to convert boxed values to needed integer type. However, it throws exceptions, so it is too hard to implement behavior that matches simple explicit cast between integer types. As a solution - add TryXXX methods to Convert class.  Additionally, it would be nice to have option to make Convert behave like explicit cast. For example, this is valid:  ``` C# int a = -1; int b = (int)(uint)a; ```  But this is not:  ``` C# int a = -1; int b = Convert.ToInt32(Convert.ToUInt32(a)); ```  This can be really useful when you process some data as ""just some bytes"" and you may get either signed or unsigned boxed value at input. As a possible solution - add overload that accepts second boolean argument and acts like an explicit integer cast.  Example of this problems and required workaround can be seen in Enum class, in particular here: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/src/System/Enum.cs#L207 "
686	area-Meta	(Proposal) Coding Guidelines.

The combined width is less than the 80 character width limit.  ``` c# if( arg0 == null ) throw new ArgumentException( nameof( arg0 ) ); if( arg0 == null ) { throw new ArgumentException( nameof( arg0 ) ); }; ```  vs  ``` c# if( arg0 == null ) {     throw new ArgumentException( nameof( arg0 ) ); } ```  Consider multiple guards statements you are approaching halve of the length of the screen, ever before you've reached the core of the method. - Simple case clause  ``` c# select ( value ) {  case 0: return ""Zero"";  case 1: return ""One"";  case 2: return ""Two"";  // ...  case 9: return ""Nine"";  default:    return ""Foo""; } ```  vs  ``` c# select ( value ) {  case 0:    return ""Zero"";  case 1:     return ""One"";  case 2:     return ""Two"";  // ...   case 9:     return ""Nine"";  default:    return ""Foo""; } ```  15 LoC rather than 25 or 35 if you need to include the `break`  ``` case 0: output = ""Zero""; break;  ``` - 2 space indentation     Consider the case of pattern-matching, each scope gets indented, 5 levels of indentation and you're already used a quarter of the permitted code width. - Method Parameter align vertically     If the method signature is getting ""too"" wide, then consider vertical alignment.  ``` c# internal static MethodSymbol DefineScriptEntryPoint   (    CSharpCompilation           compilation,          PEModuleBuilder      moduleBeingBuilt,               TypeSymbol            returnType,                     bool  hasDeclarationErrors,            DiagnosticBag  diagnostics   )  {  ```  ``` c# internal static MethodSymbol DefineScriptEntryPoint(CSharpCompilation compilation, PEModuleBuilder moduleBeingBuilt, TypeSymbol returnType, bool hasDeclarationErrors, DiagnosticBag diagnostics)  { ```  **NOTE** I not say that the existing code should be altered (it would still be valid according to the guidelines) but allow pull-requests to use some permitted alternatives forms.

692	area-System.Runtime	Add a non-generic version of Enum.TryParse	These are the methods in Enum class related to string parsing.  ``` c# public static object Parse(Type enumType, string value); public static object Parse(Type enumType, string value, bool ignoreCase);  public static bool TryParse<TEnum>(string value, out TEnum result)  where TEnum : struct; public static bool TryParse<TEnum>(string value, bool ignoreCase, out TEnum result)  where TEnum : struct; ```  Apparently Parse is exposed only in non-generic form, while TryParse is only exposed in generic form. This is somewhat inconsistent.  It is simple enough to call a non-generic method in a generic method, but not the other way around. So Parse can be made generic using the following helper. But it is a lot harder to wrap TryParse<T> into TryParse(Type enumType) without reflection calls.  ``` c# public static TEnum Parse<TEnum>(string value, bool ignoreCase) {     return Enum.Parse(typeof(TEnum), value, ignoreCase); } ```  The suggestion is to add a non-generic Enum.TryParse method, the API signature would look like  ``` c# public static bool TryParse(Type enumType, string value, out object result)  public static bool TryParse(Type enumType, string value, bool ignoreCase, out object result)  ``` 
693	area-System.Runtime	Add Enum.SetFlag and Enum.RemoveFlag to make bitwise flagging easier	To maintain multiple bool states in a class, instead of declaring many bool fields, an enum flag can be used to compact these states in to a single member to optimize for memory usage.  ``` c# [Flags] enum DirtyFlags { X = 1, Y = 1 << 1, Z = 1 << 2 };  DirtyFlags dirtyFlags = DirtyFlags.X | DirtyFlags.Y | DirtyFlags.Z; ```  It is simple to test if a flag is set using `Enum.HasFlag(DirtyFlags.X)`, but the scenario is not complete. Without the ability to set and remove a flag, the following code needs to be maintained manually:  ``` c# // Setting a flag dirtyFlags |= DirtyFlags.X; // Removing a flag, this is harder to remember :( dirtyFlags &= ^DirtyFlags.X; ```  The suggestion is to add 2 methods to Enum to help set and clear a flag.  ``` c# public bool HasFlag(Enum flag); // This method already exists public bool SetFlag(Enum flag); public bool RemoveFlag(Enum flag); ```  These methods should be aggressively inlined since bitwise manipulations is very likely to be used in a performance sensitive scenario.

To address I always ensure the outputs are newer by touching them at the end of the target whenever it is ran.  Also realized that our BuildPackages target was not being run any longer on clean builds and only on incremental builds. This showed that it is recently broken by the latest build tools update and I filed #758 for that but for now I'm disabling the building of the packaging.

An attempt to address #679  This change adds a BuildAndTest and Test target to our default dir.targets file and hooks RunTestsForProject off the Test target so that by default if you build an individual project from the command line or in an IDE like VS it will just do the build and not run the tests. If people want to run the tests then they need to execute the BuildAndTest target (or just the Test target). This prevents the need for us to use special conditions like BuildingInsideVisualStudio in our targets.

800	area-Infrastructure	Enable code coverage on VS2015 and include more libraries	Two issues: 1) Code coverage doesn't work with VS2015. 2) Several of our libraries are disabled from code coverage.  For the first, the issue turned out to be a failure of the OpenCover code coverage tool to read the PDBs produced by Roslyn.  The library on which the tool depends for PDB reading has been updated to support Roslyn, and a more recent version of OpenCover than the one we're currently using pulls in that updated version of the PDB reader.  As such, the fix is just to upgrade which version of OpenCover we use.  For the second, whatever reason caused us to disable code coverage on several projects appear to have since been addressed, either by us or in the OpenCover update.  The fix then is to just re-enable code coverage on these libraries.  The only library that remains disabled for code coverage is System.Diagnostics.Process.dll.

While we've made `protected` members `public` in the past (such as `Exception.HResult`), this event was marked `virtual`, which while binary compatible, would be a source-breaking change for those that overrode it. I suspect very little have overridden it, but we may want to consider adding a new event with a different name such as `Changed`. "

ReadFile fails with invalid param error code because our handle was opened for overlapped IO.  For now, I'm changing the code to be more defensive and always fall back to the slow file -> managed heap -> native heap code path. (It currently throws.)  @ericstj: Can you help me figure out how to tweak FileStreamReadLightUp.cs to handle this?  Also, @tmat has already mentioned to me that this code path will slow us down on Linux and Mac. Perhaps, this is the right opportunity to define a portable FileStream.Read overload that reads to unmanaged memory?

992	area-System.Numerics	Consider saturated arithmetic functionality for Vector<T>	In the past, we've seen some requests for Vector<T> to provide some means to do saturated arithmetic operations. Such operations could be useful for a variety of applications, like signal processing, image processing, etc. It makes sense to at least investigate what such functionality would look like, how it could be exposed, etc. Given that there are also SSE2+ instructions that expose some level of saturated arithmetic, I'm hopeful that we could also get some baseline hardware-instruction support for this.  Work to do: - Define API surface exposed (which operations are supported) - Define which types support these operations (which integral types? all?) - Determine which operations could benefit from SIMD instructions - Create a simple working prototype (without hardware instructions) - Create formal API design speclet

One of the challenges was developing a generic but straightforward interface for utilizing such operations across all of the (integral) numeric types that Vector<T> supports.  Work to be done: - Define which operations are supported (shuffle at a minimum) - Determine which operations could benefit from SIMD instructions   - These should be able to benefit greatly - Create a simple working prototype (without hardware instructions) - Create formal API design speclet and follow regular procedure

1008	area-System.Numerics	Faster and/or vectorized sin/cos	In certain types of applications, the extra precision and correctness afforded by Math.Sin() and Math.Cos() are not worth the performance penalty they impose. These applications are often already using primarily single precision floats for computations, and thus have to round trip through double to make use of these methods. I propose adding a FastMath or Mathf or similar set of methods for lower precision high performance implementations of these methods.  If it were not for the existence of System.Numerics.Vectors, I would advocate that these simply be an external library separate from the core framework, but since the vector math library ships Quaternion and Matrix support, I would vastly prefer that these types make use of the faster math operations for things like calculating rotations. My reasoning is that these types exist in the first place for people concerned with performance, and as it stands they're simply too slow compared to the alternatives for them to see much use.  For a practical anecdote, I recently wrote an OpenGL draw call stress test to determine CPU overhead and how many draw calls I can push from my .NET app. By far the biggest consumer of frame time was Sin and Cos inside the quaternion rotation method used to rotate the cubes I was rendering. Using a fully managed implementation of SinCos based on the venerable CEPHES library cut that time roughly in half. This could be further extended by vectorizing with SIMD, provided that the Vector types support a few more intrinsics such as shuffle.  I wouldn't mind doing this work if people think it would be useful. My main concern is that shipping System.Numerics.Vectors (quaternions and matrices) without these faster math routines will forever doom them to obscurity, since switching to reduced precision operations in the future would be a breaking change.

A user could implement algorithms that work entirely in safe code that could benefit from avoiding the allocation and rigmarole of copying data out of a register to an array when you just want to test if a field is not empty.   Admittedly, it is a downer as ARM does not have an intrinsic for this operation but there is workarounds that should perform better than copying everything in and out memory to test the bytes. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11870910/sse-mm-movemask-epi8-equivalent-method-for-arm-neon

I don't know how many people have written similar APIs too. We also use our own disposables to run actions.

1051	area-System.Text	RegexGroup should provide a Name	#### Background  Regex group can have names assigned to them (e.g. `(?<name>.+)`). Those names can be used in an indexer of `RegexGroupCollection`, however the `RegexGroup` objects themselves do not provide a `Name` property.  The names can be retrieved using `regex.GetGroupNames`, but it is not immediately obvious -- and I'm not sure it is even possible if static `Regex` method was used for matching.  To prove it is not obvious, see this [Regex: get the name of captured groups in C#](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1381097/regex-get-the-name-of-captured-groups-in-c-sharp) which at the moment had 48 votes on question, and 66 on answer. There are a few similar questions as well. #### API Design  ``` csharp public class RegexGroup : ... {     // ...     public string Name { get; } } ```  Note that for numbered groups this should return group index as string, for consistency with `Regex.GetGroupNames`. #### Compatibility  At the moment I do not see any potential compatibility issues with adding a property. 
1052	area-System.IO	Initial commit of System.IO.FileSystem tests (File, Directory, FI, DI)	Initial commit of ported tests for the System.IO.FileSystem contract. Includes tests for File, Directory, FileInfo, and DirectoryInfo.  A few tests have been rewritten in the xunit style, but the majority of these tests have been ported from ToF, which were ported from old tree.  When porting, I modified or disabled tests to make sure every test only writes in its working directory.  I verified this with PerfView.  I also replaced hard-coded paths with calls to Path.GetRandomFileName() to prevent multiple runs from interfering with each other, and multiple tests running in parallel from interfering with each other.  Any test that used a delay to wait for the state of the file system to stabilize was marked with OuterLoopAttribute.  On my machine, all of the tests including OuterLoop take between 10s and 15s to run.  Just inner loop tests take between 1s and 2s to run.  Lots of these tests are candidates for rewriting, and Eric introduced a useful base class for tests when he rewrote the FileStream tests.  Checking in these ported assets will give us a good idea of what the coverage is, and act as a baseline to compare the rewritten tests against. 
1053	area-System.ComponentModel	Make DisplayNameAttribute available in .NET Core	This was originally going to be a request to move `DisplayNameAttribute` into Core, but the problem seems a little bigger than that. Currently, `System.dll` houses approximately a couple hundred types spread across four dozen different namespaces, but not everything in it is listed on the [Open Source Progress table](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx-progress/blob/master/src-diff/README.md) (although a select few namespaces like `System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates` _are_ there).  This still makes some namespaces (for example `System.ComponentModel`) feel incomplete because of how they're spread across different assemblies. The previously mentioned `X509Certificates` namespace is already being tracked with all its types from `System.dll`, so other namespaces should follow suit, right?  I was porting a project of mine over to see the ASP.NET vNext templates in action, but the lack of `DisplayNameAttribute` is literally the only thing preventing me from building it (even if I tell it to not target .NET Core) without commenting those attributes out. And if .NET Core's philosophy is to only use what you need, why should I be forced to import some monolithic DLL with hundreds of types that I don't need just for the one that I _do_ need, because that type is not in the DLL named after its containing namespace? \(_o)/

1063	area-Meta	Append guidelines with how PR feedback should be addressed	"Pull request guidelines should contain something like ""rule of a thumb"" which rule how PR feedback should be addressed or how merge conflicts should be resolved.  As example consider #972. Commits like `Merge branch 'master' into Issue587` (aaa5434) clutter history and should be avoided. `git rebase` should be used for updating branch with fix. Other commits in this PR could be squashed.  As another example consider PR  #1003. It's initial commit of the library so it's OK to address feedback in a separate commit. However in this PR  feedback addressed twice and the second could be amended to the first.  Conclusion: 1. Merge conflicts should be resolved through rebasing. 2. PR feedback should be in a separate commit if it contains important changes. Changes like formatting or renaming variable introduced in PR are not important and could be addressed through amending/rebasing. "
1068	area-System.Reflection	Allow ISignatureTypeProvider to be a struct	The `SignatureDecoder` takes the provider as a naked interface. This makes it inefficient to bake it by a struct because it will cause it being boxed each time it's passed.  However, it's very desirable to make the provider a struct because it allows the caller to provide call site specific information.  For example, in order for implementers to reference the generic type parameters of the method or type, the `ISignatureTypeProvider` needs to have access to the containing type / containing method.  To avoid the boxing operation, the methods simply needs an additional contraint like so:  ``` csharp public static TType DecodeType<TType, TProvider>(Handle handle, TProvider provider)     where TProvider : ISignatureTypeProvider<TType> ```  Unfortunately, this causes some noise as C# is no longer able to infer the type arguments, so each call site must now qualify the type arguments.

This not ideal when using a MemoryStream or when another action needs to be taken on the result.  The workarounds are manually calling `FlushFinalBlock()` and then getting the MemoryStream bytes before disposing the CryptoStream, or using a custom stream that ignores the dispose call from CryptoStream. Neither are ideal and can be avoided with a ""leaveOpen"" option.  Implementation would be the same as DeflateStream, on `Dispose()` check if leaveOpen is true and don't close the internal stream.  ``` public CryptoStream(Stream stream, ICryptoTransform transform, CryptoStreamMode mode, bool leaveOpen) ```  I'm happy to do the change when System.Security.Cryptography.Encryption arrives.

1081	area-System.Diagnostics	Proposal: Add new property for getting process path	"## Rationale and Usage    In order to get process path you need to use `someProcess.MainModule.FileName` property. However it suffers from a couple of issue:  - Accessing MainModule of 64 bit process from a 32 bit one throws an exception  - You can't access MainModule of elevated process from a non elevated one    As you can see many developers [encounter](http://stackoverflow.com/q/8431298/239438) [these](http://stackoverflow.com/q/9501771/239438) issues.      I suggest adding a new property which returns the path to executable of the Process. To overcome the issues that I described we can use `QueryFullProcessImageName` together with `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` access right.    ## Api Proposal    ```csharp      namespace System.Diagnostics  {       public class  Process : Component       {             public string MainModuleFilePath { get; }       }  }  ```    ## Open Questions  Should the new property be called `MainModuleFilePath` or something else? From my own experience most of people use `Path` when asking question on stackoverflow but @Priya91 suggested calling it `MainModuleFilePath` as it is returning Path of the `MainModule` property.    ## Cross Platform Support  To implement this property on other platforms on Linux we can use `readlink` to read the value of `""/proc/%d/exe""` symlink and on OS X we can use `proc_pidpath` which returns process path given process pid."
1085	area-System.Reflection	MetadataReader:  (THandle)(Handle)default(THandle) should round-trip for all handles	For most handles default(THandle) is the canonical nil value that can convert to the weakly-typed Handle and back, but for some such as StringHandle and NamespaceHandle default(THandle) is an invalid value that becomes a nil module handle on conversion to Handle and cannot be round-tripped back to THandle.

Please add the ability to retrieve path with actual case via `FileInfo` and `DirectoryInfo` classes. The candidate member being `FullPath` and `Name`. Perhaps there is some sophisticated way of getting it from win32 file system API, but [that](http://stackoverflow.com/a/81493/1712065) seems to be a working solution.

1151	area-System.Numerics	New API for single-precision math	### Rationale  The .NET framework does not currently provide scalar single-precision floating-point support for many of the trigonometric, logarithmic, and other common mathematical functions.  Single-precision floating-point support should be provided for these mathematical functions in order to better interop with high-performance, scientific, and multimedia-based applications where single-precision floating-points are the only implementation required and/or used.  Since adding these methods to the existing `System.Math` class would break backwards compatibility, they should be provided through a separate class that provides the same and/or similar functionality.  Providing these new APIs would: - improve code readability (especially in the non-hardware backed implementations of methods in the `System.Numerics.Vector` structs) - improve code performance in areas where the single-precision implementation is all that is required - provide better interoperability with high-performance, scientific, and multimedia-based applications where data structures and existing code may be dependent on single-precision implementations of such methods. - provide a more advanced infrastructure for mathematics in the CoreCLR ### Proposed API  The proposed API here provides feature-parity with the existing double-precision math functions provided by the framework. #### System.BitConverter  ``` C# public static class BitConverter {     public static float Int32BitsToSingle(int);     public static int SingleToInt32Bits(float); } ``` #### System.Single  ``` C# public static partial class MathF {     public const float E = 2.71828183f;     public const float PI = 3.14159265f;      // Trigonometric Functions     public static float Acos(float);     public static float Asin(float);     public static float Atan(float);     public static float Atan2(float, float);     public static float Cos(float);     public static float Sin(float);     public static float Tan(float);      // Hyperbolic Functions     public static float Cosh(float);     public static float Sinh(float);     public static float Tanh(float);      // Exponential Functions     public static float Exp(float);      // Logarithmic Functions     public static float Log(float);     public static float Log(float, float);     public static float Log10(float);      // Power Functions     public static float Pow(float, float);     public static float Sqrt(float);      // Rounding Functions     public static float Ceiling(float);     public static float Floor(float);     public static float Round(float);     public static float Round(float, int);     public static float Round(float, int, MidpointRounding);     public static float Round(float, MidpointRounding);     public static float Truncate(float);      // Manipulation Functions     public static int Sign(float);      // Minimum, Maximum, and Difference Functions     public static float Max(float, float);     public static float Min(float, float);      // Other Functions     public static float Abs(float);     public static float IEEERemainder(float, float); } ``` ### Example Usage  Currently to calculate the Tangent for each member of the `System.Numerics.Vector4` struct, you currently have to call the double-precision version of the method and cast to the result to a single-precision value:  ``` C# public static Vector4 Acos(Vector4 value) {     return new Vector4((float)(Math.Acos(value.X)),                        (float)(Math.Acos(value.Y)),                        (float)(Math.Acos(value.Z)),                        (float)(Math.Acos(value.W))); } ```  With the proposed changes, this would now be simplified to the following:  ``` C# public static Vector4 Acos(Vector4 value) {     return new Vector4(Mathf.Acos(value.X),                        Mathf.Acos(value.Y),                        Mathf.Acos(value.Z),                        Mathf.Acos(value.W)); } ```  The `System.Numerics` library itself is filled with similar examples as are various bits of code in the CoreFX and CoreCLR repositories. ### Perf Numbers  All performance tests are implemented as follows: - 100,000 iterations are executed - The time of all iterations are aggregated to compute the `Total Time` - The time of all iterations are averaged to compute the `Average Time` - A single iteration executes some simple operation, using the function under test, 5000 times  The execution time below is the `Total Time` for all 100,000 iterations, measured in seconds.  **Hardware: Desktop w/ 3.7GHz Quad-Core A10-7850K (AMD) and 16GB RAM**  | Function | Improvment | Execution Time - Double | Execution Time - Single | | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | | Abs | 0.199243555% | 0.63752649s | 0.63625626s | | Acos | 12.30220910% | 11.5265412s | 10.1085220s | | Asin | 18.66801808% | 11.9472425s | 9.71692911s | | Atan | 21.10350002% | 10.9964683s | 8.67582861s | | Atan2 | 20.51327307% | 24.3328097s | 19.3413540s | | Ceiling | 12.91487191% | 1.87116459s | 1.62950608s | | Cos | 5.026665542% | 7.19916547s | 6.83728750s | | Cosh | 16.46166555% | 13.5416170s | 11.3124413s | | Exp | 33.67586387% | 6.65578424s | 4.41439140s | | Floor | 10.39208688% | 1.74655247s | 1.56504922s | | Log | 19.81117664% | 6.42244806s | 5.15008553s | | Log10 | 18.40605725% | 6.75118866s | 5.50856101s | | Pow | 47.85595440% | 31.8820155s | 16.6245727s | | Round | 0.976398142% | 4.22620632s | 4.18494172s | | Sin | 15.49539339% | 5.98022268s | 5.05356365s | | Sinh | 17.96609899% | 14.6242270s | 11.9968239s | | Sqrt | 4.676516651% | 2.51281945s | 2.39530703s | | Tan | 30.33470555% | 9.07290178s | 6.32066374s | | Tanh | 0.108182099% | 8.12724112s | 8.11844890s |  I believe some extra perf will be squeezed out when the intrinsics (such as `CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Sqrt`) are properly implemented in the VM layer for single-precision values. Without such functionality, it falls back to the double-precision functionality (extra precision, reduced performance) for certain calls. ### Pull Request  There is a sample pull request covering these changes available: dotnet/coreclr#5492 ### Additional Details  This will require several changes in the CoreCLR as well to support the new APIs via FCALLs and Intrinsics. 
1153	area-System.Console	Bring back Console.ReadKey()	For reference, see issue #311 and the related aspnet/Hosting#140.   Console.ReadKey() can solve both issues (thought explicit support for CancelKeyPress is nice as that can handle different keyboard configurations etc).     ReadKey() is a helpful API for many console app scenarios and is quite difficult for users to implement in a non-Windows-specific way if they want to get the same functionality.   Please consider bringing it back. 
1155	area-System.Linq	Ordering of ParallelEnumerable.GroupJoin and Join	"This feels strange or bug-ish to me, but I'm not seeing anything either way in documentation.  The following:    ```c#  ParallelQuery<int> left = Enumerable.Range(1, 4).AsParallel().AsOrdered();  ParallelQuery<int> right = Enumerable.Range(8, 32).AsParallel().AsOrdered();  foreach (Tuple<int, IEnumerable<int>> p in left.GroupJoin(right, x => x, y => y / 8, (k, g) => Tuple.Create(k, g)))  {      Console.Write(p.Item1.ToString() + "":"");      foreach (int i in p.Item2)      {          Console.Write(i.ToString() + "","");      }      Console.WriteLine();  }  Console.Read();  ```    ... has output like this:  ![groupjoin](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5569508/6683955/d5efffe4-cccf-11e4-8958-4dfde0993f1d.jpg)  The first grouping is out of order, whereas I'm expecting even the grouped elements to be returned in order (which is what the non-parallel version does).  Strangely, of the multiple times I've run it, only the first run has ever been out of order.  Using `OrderBy` on the right query tends to result in other runs being disordered....    `Join` has similar problems to `GroupJoin`:    ```c#  ParallelQuery<int> left = Enumerable.Range(1, 4).AsParallel().AsOrdered();  ParallelQuery<int> right = Enumerable.Range(8, 32).AsParallel().AsOrdered();  int prev = 0;  foreach (Tuple<int, int> p in left.Join(right, x => x, y => y / 8, (k, g) => Tuple.Create(k, g)))  {      if (prev != p.Item1)      {          Console.WriteLine();          Console.Write(p.Item1.ToString() + "":"");          prev = p.Item1;      }      Console.Write(p.Item2.ToString() + "","");  }  Console.Read();  ```    ... is producing output that looks like this:  ![join](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5569508/6684267/ee062632-ccd2-11e4-8363-679f7ed8dd0b.png)  ...where every run is disordered.    This is the behavior of the current consumer release as well.    So is this ""intended"" behavior, and the documentation should be updated to warn people about the change from the sequential version (which explicitly states the ordering of the child elements is preserved), or is this an actual bug?    @stephentoub , @svick , any thoughts?

1168	area-System.Numerics	Vector Shuffling Operations	"As mentioned in #993, a lot of useful SIMD code relies on shuffling data around within registers. There are a whole bunch of instructions available to do this, so we'd like to expose a coherent subset of these via Vector<T>. ## Rationale and Usage  Simple stream processing, such as the operations already supported on Vector<T>, are entirely parallel and thus don't benefit from shuffling operations. However, lots of common uses of SIMD do require it, such as doing geometric vector operations like matrix multiplies and vector cross products. These are key scenarios for certain users, such as game developers.  If rearranging elements is required for an algorithm and fast hardware support is not provided, the cost of loading and storing to and from SIMD registers might exceed any benefits gained from using SIMD in the first place.  When looking at existing libraries that wrap SIMD functionality at a low level, it's apparent that there are a few main use cases of shuffle: - Permuting the elements of two different vectors into a result - ""Swizzling"" the elements within a single vector - ""Splatting"" or ""broadcasting"" one element to all others within a single vector  Rather than expose one single shuffle method directly, I think it makes sense to go with this slightly higher level functionality such that the API doesn't become too tied to a particular architecture's instruction set. ## Proposed API  New methods on the Vector<T> struct:  ``` csharp // pick elements from a and b to place into result internal static unsafe Vector<T> Permute2 (Vector<T> a, Vector<T> b, int s0, int s1); internal static unsafe Vector<T> Permute4 (Vector<T> a, Vector<T> b, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3);  // rearrange elements within a internal static unsafe Vector<T> Swizzle2 (Vector<T> a, int s0, int s1); internal static unsafe Vector<T> Swizzle4 (Vector<T> a, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3);  // rearrange bytes in a internal static unsafe Vector<T> ShuffleBytes (Vector<T> a, Vector<byte> mask);  // broadcast specified element to all other elements in a internal static unsafe Vector<T> Splat (Vector<T> a, int element); ```  New methods on Vector class that are simple wrappers around the Vector<T> methods.  ``` csharp public static Vector<double> Permute (Vector<double> a, Vector<double> b, int s0, int s1); public static Vector<long> Permute (Vector<long> a, Vector<long> b, int s0, int s1); public static Vector<ulong> Permute (Vector<ulong> a, Vector<ulong> b, int s0, int s1); public static Vector<float> Permute (Vector<float> a, Vector<float> b, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3); public static Vector<int> Permute (Vector<int> a, Vector<int> b, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3); public static Vector<uint> Permute (Vector<uint> a, Vector<uint> b, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3);  public static Vector<double> Swizzle (Vector<double> a, int s0, int s1); public static Vector<long> Swizzle (Vector<long> a, int s0, int s1); public static Vector<ulong> Swizzle (Vector<ulong> a, int s0, int s1); public static Vector<float> Swizzle (Vector<float> a, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3); public static Vector<int> Swizzle (Vector<int> a, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3); public static Vector<uint> Swizzle (Vector<uint> a, int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3);  public static Vector<T> ShuffleBytes (Vector<T> a, Vector<byte> mask);  public static Vector<T> Splat (Vector<T> a, int element); ``` ## Details and Questions - There are a lot of tradeoffs when picking method signatures for shuffle. For example, instead of taking many selector parameters, we could instead have one combined integer mask. However, pretty much every single caller will then implement their own helper method to do the bitwise combination of the mask, so all callsites get more complicated. Additionally, we want the JIT to discover and optimize the cases where the parameters are JIT-time constants. - I chose for the selector parameters to be ints instead of, say, bytes. I'm not sure if there's a compelling reason to choose one over the other. In either case, we'd have to define what happens when the parameters are out of range. Since the intrinsics are going to bitwise combine them, in the interests of speed it'd be good if they could say that are not range checked. - We could also have a Permute8 and Swizzle8 and extend the methods to shorts and ushorts. The parameter lists get kind of unwieldy... - ShuffleBytes is an interesting case. pshufb is a very useful instruction to expose, but it's an SSSE3 instruction. It may be worth being more explicit about which features are supported by the hardware via some set of caps flags instead of the single boolean IsHardwareAccelerated we have now. - Shuffle intrinsically breaks the abstraction of Vector<T> of not needing to know the underlying register size. Honestly, I think that's an unworkable abstraction in the long term; it's too difficult to write usage code that can work with arbitrarily sized vectors, so it might be worth exploring having specifically sized Vector128<T>, Vector256<T>, etc. This is clearly a discussion to be had in a separate issue though.

1170	area-System.Collections	IEnumerator.Current does not throw after hitting the end of the collection.	This issue is in the `List<T>.Enumerator` class. When the collection is enumerated to then end and then modified, accessing `IEnumerator.Current` returns `default(T)` rather than throwing. According to the [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.collections.ienumerator.current%28v=vs.100%29.aspx) it should throw.  Simple Test case:  ``` CSharp var list = new List<int>{0,1}; var enumerator = ((IEnumerable)list).GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator.MoveNext()){} list.Add(2); Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>(() => enumerator.Current); ```  This test fails currently with `enumerator.Current` returning 0.

1182	area-System.Linq	System.Linq performance improvement suggestions	"With Linq-to-Objects it is quite common practice to perform a series of transformations, and then materialize sequence to a concrete collection type by calling _ToArray(), ToList(), ToDictionary()_. These operations would work much faster if they knew the number of elements in the sequence.  Currently System.Linq.Enumerable has special treatment for _ICollection<T>_ interface only.  I suppose that additional support for _IReadOnlyCollection<T>_ can improve performance in some cases, because through it we can figure out the total number of elements.  Another problem with System.Linq is that in many cases the information about the number of elements is lost. One of the most common example:  ``` C# List<int> source = ...; List<int> transformed = source.Select(o => o + 1).ToList(); ```  Obviously _Select_ does not change the number of elements in the sequence, but _ToList_ method cannot take advantage of that. Information is lost. In this particular scenario, it would be great for _Select_ to return some _SelectIterator_ instance, which implements _IReadOnlyCollection<T>_, and thereby passes the number of elements to the subsequent methods.  **Steps to measure performance gain**: 1. Find in _System.Linq.Tests\Performance_ the test for the method you've changed; 2. Uncomment `[Fact]` attribute above that method; 3. Build test project by Visual Studio in Release mode; 4. Go to the folder with tests binaries: `bin\tests\Windows_NT.AnyCPU.Release\System.Linq.Tests\aspnetcore50\`; 5. Open command prompt (cmd.exe or PowerShell); 6. Run command: `CoreRun.exe xunit.console.netcore.exe System.Linq.Tests.dll -parallel none -trait ""Perf=true""`; 7. Wait for results that will be printed right in the command window; 8. Don't forget to run tests with different collection sizes. This can be done by varying _elementCount_ argument of _Measure_ method.  **Casting to `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`** is a slow operation so it is not a good idea to check if this interface implemented. The performance drop will be most noticeable on the small collections.  **Tasks**: - [ ] `Select`: add iterators for `List<T>`, `Array[T]`, `ICollection<T>`; - [ ] `ToArray`, `ToDictionary`: add special support for `ICollection<T>` (and, very carefully, for `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`) to get the initial capacity; - [ ] `ToList` (???): add special support for `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` to get the initial capacity (separated as it will affect _System.Collections.Generic_); - [ ] `OrderBy(Descending)/ThanBy(Descending)`: implement special iterator for `ICollection<T>` to propagate `Count`; - [ ] `Cast`, `Reverse`: add iterators for `ICollection<T>` to propagate `Count`; - [ ] `Range`, `Repeat`: add an iterator that implements `ICollection<T>`; - [ ] `Skip`, `Take`: add an iterator that handle `ICollection<T>`; - [x] Add performance tests for _System.Linq_ "
1187	area-System.Collections	Improve the exception message of ToDictionary when keys are duplicated	"`Enumerable.ToDictionary` makes it easy to turn an array into a dictionary. But when the keys are duplicated in the source array, it just throws an `ArgumentException` that says **An entry with the same key already exists**. It is hard to know what keys are duplicated.  To improve the exception message without adding extra overhead, the exception message can be modified to **$""An entry with the key { key }  already exists""**.  `ToDictionary` internally calls `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.Add()`, so the improvement made to Dictionary.Add benefits all code that calls the method.

It's not too hard to craft your own one, give it a try!""  The following applies to `TrimEnd` / `TrimStart`, but the overloads would be 1:1, so I will discuss only `TrimEnd`.  **First overload:**  `public string TrimEnd(string suffix)`  Behaviour: trim the suffix, case-sensitive, and only once.

1271	area-System.Runtime	Add overload for case insensitive string Replace	"# Introduction    `String` does not provide `Replace` method for case-insensitive replacements, but only for case-sensitive replacements.   # Rationale and usage    The idea here is to make programmers life easier & move closer to API consistency.     It is fairly common scenario where you have user inserted data that has some kind of place-holders (tokens), that later have to be replaced by some templating system.     Current solutions in the internet involve using regex class for this trivial task.     ```c#  var userTemplateData = ""Hello there. Time now is %currenttime%"";  var evaluatedData = Regex.Replace(                        userTemplateData,                         ""%CurrentTime%"",                          DateTime.Now.ToString(),                         RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);    // evaluatedData = ""Hello there. Time now is 01/04/2015 14:37"";  ```    This approach is horrible:   1) not readable  2) often times not correct, as pattern has to be run through `Regex.Escape` before.  3) most likely slow(er)    After the necessary change is added, we can do:    ```c#  var evaluatedData = userTemplateData.Replace(                                           ""%CurrentTime%"",                                             DateTime.Now.ToString(),                                             StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);  ```    How common would the usage of this be? I would **speculate** that every programmer in their career will hit the lack of case-insensitive replacement in framework at least once. I can't say much more, expect provide some StackOverflow links below in Details section.    I did quick search through the code-base I am new to, and found around ~30 case-insensitive `Regex.Replace` usages.   # Proposed API    ```c#  public sealed class String : ...  {      ....        // these two methods are provided for framework consistency      // trying to follow the StartsWith/EndsWith      public string Replace(string oldValue, string newValue, StringComparison comparison);      public string Replace(string oldValue, string newValue, bool ignoreCase, CultureInfo culture);        public string Replace(char oldValue, char newValue, CompareOptions options);          ....  }  ```  # Details    Namespace: **System**  Type: **System.String**  Assembly: **System.Runtime.dll**    I'd love to see the current `string.Replace` [CoreClr implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/cbf46fb0b6a0b209ed1caf4a680910b383e68cba/src/classlibnative/bcltype/stringnative.cpp#L835) pulled out from CoreClr, and implemented 100% in the `String.cs`:       This would help to:  - avoid code-duplication  - make it more transparent (programmers can take look at the implementation)   - unit-test a little less, as they share both common functionality for `Replace(..., StringComparison.Ordinal);`    Alternatively, we could also modify the existing `CoreClr` implementation to deal with `StringComparison`. Or, just rewrite everything from zero.  # Links to explore    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244531/is-there-an-alternative-to-string-replace-that-is-case-insensitive    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6275980/string-replace-by-ignoring-case    http://weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway/71188  # Updates  - Edited this description to make it more of a **speclet**, based on the discussion below and the proposed API Review process.  - Feedback to @tarekgh.

1298	area-System.IO	System.IO.Compression test asset and native dependency proposal	"System.IO.Compression provides an API to compress and decompress files.  It supports the ZIP and gzip archive formats and the Deflate compression algorithm.    **_Testing**_  System.IO.Compression has existing test assets that fit three categories: 1.  Round trip data through compression and verify it remains intact 2.  Extract and verify data compressed through other compatible compression libraries 3.  Verify behavior when attempting to decompress invalid or edge case archives The existing assets include archives, as well as decompressed binary files both for use as source material, and an oracle to verify decompression.  Altogether, the binary assets weigh in at about 40MB.    **Problem:** these test assets need to exist at test run time.  Placing them in our corefx git repository is problematic because binary assets do not compress well and will bloat the size of our repository.  **Proposal:** Binary test assets are packaged in to a nuget package per test assembly to be deployed at test run time.  The binary assets to generate these nuget package are persisted in a single separate Git repository.  Git repository structure: corefx-testdata\ corefx-testdata\System.IO.Compression.TestData.nuspec corefx-testdata\System.IO.Compression.TestData\<binary assets>  Nupkg structure: content\<binary assets>  Test asset nuget packages are depended on by the test assemblys packages.config <packages>   <package id=""System.IO.Compression.TestData"" version=""1.0.0-prerelease"" />  Currently, nuget is designed to deploy at package reference time (ie. when a package is referenced in Visual Studio) rather than runtime.  In Dev14 this is changing.  Until then, well include a target in the test assemblys csproj to copy the assets from the downloaded nuget package to the tests working directory.  In addition to System.IO.Compression, metadata reader uses binary test assets, but as they are only 100KB combined and are not a practical problem.  System.IO.Packaging has 60GB of test assets.  **Proposal:** System.IO.Packaging split their test assets in to tiers, with a single nuget package per tier.  The inner loop tests should be no more than some number of megabytes.    **_Native Dependencies**_  In the desktop .NET Framework, although we have a purely managed implementation of the deflate algorithm, customers have reported that the popular cross-platform open-source zlib library is faster and performs high quality compression.  In response we include zlib, which we wrap and delegate to.  We build it from source using the unmodified 1.2.3 version of the sources in the FX partition, and name the resulting output clrcompression.dll.   On Windows, to fit with .NET Cores app-local, side-by-side model, if we include zlib, we should deploy a copy of the native assembly alongside the managed System.IO.Compression.dll assembly included with an application.  zlib distributes both sources and official binaries.  While we could redistribute the official zlib binary, unfortunately they only release a 32-bit version and we are currently distributing a 64-bit version of coreclr. While zlib has a permissive license, it is not the MIT license, and including it in the corefx repository would mean the corefx repository no longer only contained code under a single license.  **Proposal:** Continue building clrcompression.dll from the FX repository.  Publish the 64-bit version of clrcompression.dll in a nuget package System.IO.Compression.clrcompression-x64.nupkg.  Make System.IO.Compression.clrcompression-x64 a dependency of the System.IO.Compression package.  **X-Plat todo:** Linux has a strong history of deploying applications and their dependencies through package managers.  Packagers bundle the application binaries and metadata describing dependencies in to packages, and publish those on package manager repositories.  We are planning to declare other framework and runtime dependencies through package managers where appropriate, and System.IO.Compressions zlib dependency should be consistent. "
1305	area-System.Xml	Inconsistent behavior of XmlAttributeCollection.InsertBefore and InsertAfter	"I've noticed an inconsistent behavior of `XmlAttributeCollection.InsertAfter(XmlAttribute newNode, XmlAttribute refNode)` comparing to `InsertBefore` when the reference node is the last in the collection (the first for `InsertBefore`) and it's a duplicate of the new node. The duplicate node (attribute) needs to be removed before inserting. `InsertAfter` is unable to handle the case and throws `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException` further in `List<T>.Insert()` due to an incorrectly calculated insert position, while `InsertBefore` does the job. I'm not sure if this case has any practical use, but might be worth fixing.  The following unit test reproduces the problem:  ```     [Fact]     // [ActiveIssue(""Throws argument out of range exception"")]     public void InsertAfterRemovesDupRefAttr()     {         const string attributeName = ""existingAttr"";         const string attributeUri = ""some:existingUri"";         XmlDocument doc = CreateDocumentWithElement();         XmlElement element = doc.DocumentElement;         element.Attributes.Append(doc.CreateAttribute(""attr1"", ""some:uri1""));         element.Attributes.Append(doc.CreateAttribute(""attr2"", ""some:uri2""));         XmlAttribute refAttr = element.Attributes.Append(doc.CreateAttribute(attributeName, attributeUri)); //dup         XmlAttribute newAttr = doc.CreateAttribute(attributeName, attributeUri);          XmlAttributeCollection target = element.Attributes;         target.InsertAfter(newAttr, refAttr); // throws          // Assert...     } ```  A similar case (the reference attribute is the first in the collection) works for `InsertBefore`:  ```     [Fact]     public void InsertBeforeRemovesDupRefAttr()     {         const string attributeName = ""existingAttr"";         const string attributeUri = ""some:existingUri"";         XmlDocument doc = CreateDocumentWithElement();         XmlElement element = doc.DocumentElement;         XmlAttribute refAttr = element.Attributes.Append(doc.CreateAttribute(attributeName, attributeUri)); //dup         element.Attributes.Append(doc.CreateAttribute(""attr1"", ""some:uri1""));         element.Attributes.Append(doc.CreateAttribute(""attr2"", ""some:uri2""));         XmlAttribute newAttr = doc.CreateAttribute(attributeName, attributeUri);          XmlAttributeCollection target = element.Attributes;         target.InsertBefore(newAttr, refAttr);          // Assert...     } ``` "

1330	area-System.Linq	Parallel.Linq.Distinct not returning first element equal element in ordered queries.	"Parallel.Linq.Distinct doen't return the first ""equal"" element in ordered queries.  Take, for example, the following set: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` - and use a comparator that says everything `mod 4` is identical (so, `0` is the same as `4`, `1` and `5`, etc).  I'm somewhat expecting to get `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, but I don't - any of the 'later' identical values can be returned.  For those of you contending that ""They're identical, it doesn't matter"", which I somewhat thought too, I'm basing this on comments internal to the [Distinct operator](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Linq.Parallel/src/System/Linq/Parallel/QueryOperators/Unary/DistinctQueryOperator.cs#L238-L251):  ``` 238  // For each element, we track the smallest order key for that element that we saw so far  239  TKey oldEntry;  240  241  Wrapper<TInputOutput> wrappedElem = new Wrapper<TInputOutput>((TInputOutput)elem.First);  242  243  // If this is the first occurrence of this element, or the order key is lower than all keys we saw previously,  244  // update the order key for this element.  245  if (!_hashLookup.TryGetValue(wrappedElem, out oldEntry) || _keyComparer.Compare(orderKey, oldEntry) < 0)  246  {  247      // For each ""elem"" value, we store the smallest key, and the element value that had that key.  248      // Note that even though two element values are ""equal"" according to the EqualityComparer,  249      // we still cannot choose arbitrarily which of the two to yield.  250      _hashLookup[wrappedElem] = orderKey;  251  } ```  The [ordering page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd460677%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) just says these operators return ""ordered"" results given an ordered source, which is technically still happening - so long as there was an element in that original position, that or an equal one is returned in that position.   Vanilla LINQ actually says `Distinct` returns _unordered_ results, but I'm guessing they really meant ""we didn't use `OrderBy` to make things easier for us"", especially as all the examples (and the way the operator is implemented) show that it retains the ordering of the original source (and how the other set operators behave - `Except` doesn't mention ordering, `Intersect` explicitly mentions the original order is retained, and `Union` mostly implies the original order is retained).  So... which is correct? Should the actual-first equal element be returned (as I'm expecting), or that's a stronger guarantee than we need (and any equal item can be returned in its place)?  Example reproduction code (may fail to fail):  ``` using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using Xunit;  namespace Test {     public class Example     {         [Fact]         public static void DistinctExample()         {             ParallelQuery<int> original = ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, 24).AsOrdered();             int seen = 0;             Assert.All(original.Distinct(new ModularCongruenceComparer(4)), i => Assert.Equal(seen++, i));             Assert.Equal(4, seen);         }          private class ModularCongruenceComparer : IEqualityComparer<int>         {             private int _mod;              public ModularCongruenceComparer(int mod)             {                 _mod = Math.Max(1, mod);             }              private int leastPositiveResidue(int x)             {                 return ((x % _mod) + _mod) % _mod;             }              public bool Equals(int x, int y)             {                 return leastPositiveResidue(x) == leastPositiveResidue(y);             }              public int GetHashCode(int x)             {                 return leastPositiveResidue(x).GetHashCode();             }              public int GetHashCode(object obj)             {                 return GetHashCode((int)obj);             }         }     } } ``` "
1332	area-System.Linq	Parallel.Linq.Concat not consistent with ordered input	"`Parallel.Linq.Concat` isn't behaving consistently when given ordered input sources.  As `Concat` is a binary operator, two sources may be supplied.  The inconsistency surfaces depending on which, and how, operand is ordered.  If both **or** either (only the left or the right) is ordered via `AsOrdered()`, the entire output is ordered. If the left operator is ordered via any of the `OrderBy(...)` operators (`OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, `ThenBy`, `ThenByDescending`), the entire output is ordered. If the _right_ operator is ordered via any of the `OrderBy(...)` operators, only the _left_ output is ordered (as by `AsOrdered()`), and the right is returned in a non-deterministic order.    It only seems to do this with right sources constructed via `Enumerable.Range(...).AsParallel()` and `Partitioner.Create(...).AsParallel()`.  Using a `List` is safe (eg, `Enumerable.Range(...).ToList().AsParallel()`), however the output of LINQ is not: `list.Select(x => x).AsParallel()` can return unordered output. How the left operand is constructed appears to have no effect.  This is also the behavior of the current consumer release.  Example program:  ``` static void Main(string[] args) {     int leftSize = 8;     int rightSize = 8;       ParallelQuery<int> query = ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, leftSize)                             .Concat(Enumerable.Range(0, rightSize).AsParallel().OrderBy(x => x));      foreach (int i in query)     {         Console.Write(i + ""|"");     }     Console.ReadLine(); } ```  (This is a bit of a Heisenbug - expect it to generate completely ordered output on occasion.  It's possible that it does this for all input types, and I just haven't seen it yet, although I consider this unlikely)  The [ordering page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd460677%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) states that ordered input to `Concat` results in ordered output, and unordered input results in unordered output, but it isn't clear what happens when you have one of each.

1336	area-System.Linq	Collections should have extensions to compute order statistic	`System.Linq` has extensions implemented for computing the minimum and maximum.   Example:  ``` C# var a = new int[] {100, 300, 200, 400}; WriteLine(a.Max()); // prints 400 WriteLine(a.Min()); // prints 100 ```  While these are useful values when dealing with collections, they are merely special cases of nth order statistics. More often than not, people are also interested in a specific cases. For example, when querying the collection in the sample code above, the question may be posed, what is the 3rd smallest item in the array?  The naive implementation would be to sort the array and print the 3rd item in it. However, there are selection algorithms that can do this more efficiently, without the need to actually invoke a sort method on the array. A method should be implemented in line with the `Min` and `Max` extension methods to accomplish this. The API should be a simple as:  ``` C# WriteLine(a.NthSmallestElement(3)) // should print 300 WriteLine(a.NthSmallestElement(1)) // should print 100 WriteLine(a.NthSmallestElement(a.Length)) // should print 400 ```  The method name may differ based on further discussion. I chose the name based on C++ references that I had seen earlier.

1373	area-System.Linq	enumerable.AsParallel().LongCount() can only count int.MaxValue elements	"... as well as `enumerable.AsParallel().LongCount(x => true)` (I thought this override had a successful run, but it isn't now)  The overflow is encountered at [PartitionedDataSource.cs, line 967](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Linq.Parallel/src/System/Linq/Parallel/Partitioning/PartitionedDataSource.cs#L697).  The problem is that these partitioned data sources all presume to only operate over `int.MaxValue` elements, and the rest of the file (and related infrastructure) depend on that.  Some sort of re-architecting (rather than simply switching the key from `int` to `long`) is probably required.  Repro test:  ``` [Fact] // Extremely long-running public static void LongCount_LargeCount() {     Assert.Equal(int.MaxValue + 1L, new OverlyLargeEnumerable().AsParallel().LongCount()); }  private class OverlyLargeEnumerable : IEnumerable<long> {     public IEnumerator<long> GetEnumerator()     {         return new OverlyLargeEnumerator();     }      IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()     {         return GetEnumerator();     }      private class OverlyLargeEnumerator : IEnumerator<long>     {         private long _current = -1;          public long Current         {             get             {                 return _current;             }         }          object IEnumerator.Current         {             get             {                 return Current;             }         }          public void Dispose()         {             _current = int.MaxValue;         }          public bool MoveNext()         {             // Adds one _after_ compare, so final value is int.MaxValue + 1             return _current++ < int.MaxValue;         }          public void Reset()         {             _current = -1;         }     } } ```  Vanilla LINQ is fine.

1378	area-System.Collections	Add IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> variants to Dictionary's .ctors	We should consider adding constructors to `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` which allow building a Dictionary from an IEnumerable of KeyValueParis. ## Rationale and Usage  Given an `IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>` there's no simple way to construct a dictionary, around it.  Instead you have to do something like:  ``` csharp var dict = new Dictionary<TKey, TValue>(); foreach (KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> kvp in enum) {     dict.Add(kvp.Key, kvp.Value); } ```  or  ``` csharp var dict = enumerable.ToDictionary(kvp => kvp.Key, kvp => kvp.Value); ```  `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>` already provides such .ctors.  This is especially useful in the case where you want to make a copy of an `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>` ## Proposed API  ``` csharp   public class Dictionary<TKey, TValue> : ICollection, ICollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>, IDictionary, IDictionary<TKey, TValue>, IEnumerable, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>, IReadOnlyCollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>, IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue> {      // New .ctors     public Dictionary(IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> enumerable);     public Dictionary(IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> enumerable, IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer);       // Existing .ctors     public Dictionary();     public Dictionary(IDictionary<TKey, TValue> dictionary);     public Dictionary(IDictionary<TKey, TValue> dictionary, IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer);     public Dictionary(IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer);     public Dictionary(int capacity);     public Dictionary(int capacity, IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer);       // Remaining members removed for brevity.   } ```  See some additional discussion on this issue is at dotnet/coreclr#680

This works with normal List<T> because this guy returns -1 when an incompatible type is used, where ImmutableList<T> throws an exception (doesn't do any check actually) and ComboBox doesn't understand that very well. To make it worse ComboBox doesn't perform this stunt immediately but only after a while (when one scrolles some of its items).  Now, I'd say that this is ComboBox' fault but who knows.

Only `IList` has a similar method but it forces me to completely materialize all the source. The implementation can enumerate list or, if the original source type is `IList`, call the `IList.IndexOf` method. If the source type is an `Array` we can call `Array.IndexOf`.  What do you think?

1450	area-System.Runtime	Make TimeZoneInfo.AdjustmentRule.BaseUtcOffsetDelta public	I would like to propose that `TimeZoneInfo.AdjustmentRule.BaseUtcOffsetDelta` be marked `public` instead of `internal`.  This can be seen [here](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/d46b09d4dfc8e25d7e61a9994f89720cf01b5086/src/mscorlib/src/System/TimeZoneInfo.cs#L3754).  There are several reasons: - The `AdjustmentRule` class is loaded from registry information, loosely matching the `_REG_TZI_FORMAT` structure.  (See [this article](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2007/06/07/exploring-windows-time-zones-with-system-timezoneinfo-josh-free.aspx)). -  The whole reason this property was added ([KB3012229](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3012229)) is such that the data from the registry can be better reflected in this class.  Specifically, the `_REG_TZI_FORMAT.Bias` value can change from year to year, so `AdjustmentRule.BasUtcOffsetDelta` was created to track the delta between the year-to-year bias and the default bias for the time zone. - There's no good reason (IMHO) to keep this internal.  Doing so means that the full functionality of the `AdjustmentRule` class can really only be used when populated by the framework itself.  It also makes understanding the way that the framework populates the class difficult, as all fields are exposed through public properties _except_ this one. - It creates problems for those trying to use it in other scenarios.  See Example 2 in Jon Skeet's post [Backward Compatibility Pain](http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2015/03/02/backward-compatibility-pain/).  Additionally, there needs to be some public way to create an `AdjustmentRule` that has a value for this property.  Either the existing `CreateAdjustmentRule` factory method should be made public, or a parameter could be added to the existing constructor, or another constructor could be added.  Thanks for your consideration.

There seems to a problem with ""i"" letter or any other letter that is an inline character for a particular option (i, m, n, s, x).  If you change ""i"" with ""a"" (not an inline character), ArgumentException is thrown as expected.  Both patterns are invalid so according to the .NET documentation, both lines should throw ArgumentException. This behaviour is especially unpleasant in case of ""regex tester"" application (such as http://regexator.net) which tries to continually evaluate user input as regex pattern.

1477	area-Infrastructure	Test infrastructure requirements and scenarios	"Current updated proposal from @Chrisboh :  **Requirements we need to satisfy**      Run a set of tests that all developers should run before checking in      Specify a set of tests to run from the command line      Be able to debug all test cases      Run with code coverage turned on      Only build what is required ## Proposal  The key to this proposal starts at build time. We need to only build what we are going to run.  This is important both for overall runtime as well running tests using .net native.  In order to satisfy this we need to move our ability to filter up higher in the process.   ## Building only What is Required  The following include is where we find all of our test projects and add them to the list of items we would like to build.   **File:** CoreFX\src\dirs.proj (line 8) `<Project Include=""*\tests\**\*.csproj"" Exclude=""@(ExcludeProjects)"" />`  We need to add a condition to this to only include items that match a supplied filter.  This filter would contain the following items.  **Filter List:**      InnerLoop      Functional      Partner      Customer #### InnerLoop  This will contain everything we consider an Unit test today and until we complete the work to run our tests based on selectivity should be the minimum required set of tests that get run before accepting any PR. #### Functional (OuterLoop Ring 1)  This category is made up of test cases that will test larger sections of the code and / or take longer to run.  The tests in this category should also give us a quick high level check that there are no major issues with regards to basic performance, stress, or security. #### Partner (OuterLoop Ring 2)  The goal of this category is to determine if we are ready for team Dogfooding.  All performance and stress tests should be in this category as well as any compliance / security tests. #### Customer (OuterLoop Ring 3)  The goal of this category is to determine if we are ready to release this for Partner Dogfooding.  This will contain all scenario test cases and will have a manual component added as well. ## Defining Test Project  In order for our filtering to work correctly we need to ensure that test project is setup correctly.  The simple way to do this is to create a test project for each category in the Filter list.  This would give us at most 4 test projects but it will be more typical to have around 2 projects as I could see unifying scenario, compliance, and security tests in a single location.  In order to do this we will need to filter by test project name.  We will follow the following naming conventions.  `*.<Category>.tests.dll`  Example: `System.ObjectModel.InnerLoop.tests.dll` ## Xunit Attributes  Now it is time to address what we are going to be doing about the Xunit attributes.  First we will remove all attributes that can be replaced with the project filters.  This will include things like InnerLoop, OuterLoop, Performance, and Stress.  These attributes will not be used when deciding what binaries we should build and run.  What this doesn't mean is that we will be removing all attributes entirely.  We still need to keep and leverage certain attributes in order to give us the flexibility we need to further fine tune our runs.  Here are some of the key attributes we will need to leave in place. #### Active Issue Attribute  This attribute will be used to filter out failing test cases when running locally.  When running our daily builds we should include these test cases and label them as failing with a known bug. #### Platform Specific Attribute  This attribute will be used to filter out test cases that do not apply to the platform you are currently running on.  There was some debate on whether we should promote this to the filter list or not.  At this time we dont feel there are enough test cases to warrant promoting this to the filter list.  In the future if this becomes an issue we can revisit this. ## Command Line  We will need to execute everything from the command line as well as be able to select everything we need.  Doing so will be done via two properties.  The first will be defining the test categories that you would like to include.  This will be done with the following property.  `/p:TestTypes=""InnerLoop;Functional""`  The second property will be used to supply extra command line parameters to Xunit.  This will simply be a pass-through from the msbuild command line onto Xunit and we will use the following property for that.  `/p:AdditionalXunitArgs=""-notrait ActiveIssue""`  Additionally if you do not specify the TestTypes property it should run all Developer test cases automatically. Also not specifying the AdditionalXunitArgs property should be default exclude any test with an Active Issue and regardless if the property is specified we should include the correct OS parameter.   ## Debugging  This will be the same as what we have today.  In the future we should invest me making the Xunit.runner.VisualStudio work and this would simplify everything. "
1490	area-System.Linq	Parallel.Linq.GroupBy not using first 'equal' key.	Similar to `Distinct` ( #1330 ), `GroupBy` isn't choosing the 'first' or earliest identical element for a key.  That is, given an ordered range `{0, ... 23}`and running `GroupBy(x => x, compareMod(4))`, I'm expecting the first (lowest, here) element that occurs in the source to be chosen as the key - `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.

1502	area-System.Collections	[Proposal] Use B+-trees instead of AVL trees for Immutable Collections	Currently the `Node` class used for `ImmutableList<T>` includes 40 bytes of overhead per list element on X64, and 24 bytes of overhead on X86. This means the memory cost of using this data structure for an `ImmutableList<int>` is 1000% on X64, and 600% on X86 (these figures represent the amount of memory used for storing non-data elements associated with the structure).  I propose migrating to a B+-tree instead, using a fixed value for _b_ and declaring data values in the index and data pages directly (to avoid unnecessary memory overhead for arrays). The choice of _b_ primarily affects the following things: 1. The height of the tree. Shorter tree heights improve performance for random access lookups by improving memory locality for a majority of traversal operations. 2. The size of the pages. Mutations of immutable data structures require reconstructing pages leading back to the root. If the pages are large, mutations could become expensive.  In addition to the above, B+-trees provide a substantial memory savings by removing the child pointers (the Left and Right pointers for AVL nodes) from the leaves.  My initial calculations (which could be completely wrong) indicate that the average memory allocation required for a single mutation operation on a list of 100000 elements using the AVL structure is 775 bytes for X64 and 493 bytes for X86. The optimal value of _b_ for X64 in terms of mutation allocation overhead is _b_=8, which costs 476 bytes per operation on a list of the same size (39% reduction). For X86 this same value of _b_ costs 388 bytes per mutation (21% reduction, and _b_=6 would be optimal with 382 bytes). The overall storage overhead for _b_=8 drops a staggering amount down to 169% for X64 and 119% for X86 (counting the average page at 75% capacity, based on a merge at 50% and split at 100%).

Here's an example:  Assuming the `CombineHashCodes` method's implementation is:  ``` C# internal static int CombineHashCodes(int h1, int h2) {     return (((h1 << 5) + h1) ^ h2); } ```  100K raw data results in more than 6K duplicate hash values, that is 6% of a uniformly distributed set:  ``` C# var data = Enumerable.Range(0, 100000)     .Select(t => new     {         Val1 = t,         Val2 = 100000 + t     })     .GroupBy(t => CombineHashCodes(t.Val1.GetHashCode(), t.Val2.GetHashCode()))     .Where(t => t.Count() > 1)     .Select(t => new { Hash = t.Key, Items = t.ToList() })     .ToList(); ```  I believe there are much better hash functions to use like the one Josh Bloch suggests in Effective Java, which results in no hash collision even for 1M records of data in example above:  ``` C# internal static int CombineHashCodes(int h1, int h2) {     return (17 * 31 + h1) * 31 + h2; } ```

1513	area-System.Runtime	Add String.Split overloads that take a single char and string separator	It's extremely common to split a string based on a single `char` or `string` separator, yet `String.Split` only offers overloads that accept an array of separators. The `params char[] separator` overload is particularly insidious as the `params` usage often results in a large number of unnecessary `char[]` heap allocations, unbeknownst to the developer. ## Rationale and Usage  [Stack Exchange ran into this](http://blog.marcgravell.com/2013/11/allocaction-allocation-allocation.html) (significant number of separator arrays in memory) and submitted a [pull request](https://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/marcgravell/outputcachecleanup/contribution/7201) to ASP.NET MVC to cache `String.Split` separator arrays inside the ASP.NET MVC codebase.  They ended up with the following:  ``` c# namespace System.Web.Mvc {     internal static class StringSplits     {         // note array contents not technically read-only; just... don't edit them!         internal static readonly char[]             Period = new[] { '.' },             Comma = new[] { ',' };     } } ```  With uses of `string.Split('.')` and `string.Split(',')` replaced with `string.Split(StringSplits.Period)` and `string.Split(StringSplits.Comma)` to avoid the `char[]` allocations.  It'd be awesome if `String.Split` offered overloads that accepted a single separator to avoid this. ## Proposed API  ``` c# public partial class String {     // Proposed methods     public string[] Split(char separator, StringSplitOptions options = StringSplitOptions.None);     public string[] Split(char separator, int count, StringSplitOptions options = StringSplitOptions.None);     public string[] Split(string separator, StringSplitOptions options = StringSplitOptions.None);     public string[] Split(string separator, int count, StringSplitOptions options = StringSplitOptions.None);      // Existing methods     public string[] Split(params char[] separator);     public string[] Split(char[] separator, int count);     public string[] Split(char[] separator, StringSplitOptions options);     public string[] Split(char[] separator, int count, StringSplitOptions options);     public string[] Split(string[] separator, StringSplitOptions options);     public string[] Split(string[] separator, int count, StringSplitOptions options); } ``` ## Notes  We had wanted to add `public string[] Split(string separator)`, but this breaks source compatibility with uses of `Split(null)`, which is documented to split based on white space, because it makes the call ambiguous between `Split(char[])` and `Split(string)`.  I won't go into it here as it's really a separate feature request, but it would also be worth considering new `Split` methods that return a `struct` collection of `StringSpan`/`StringSegment` structs (in lieu of internal runtime span/substring magic) to avoid the resulting `string[]` allocation (and substring allocations, unless needed).  I'd be happy to contribute an implementation and tests. 
1514	area-System.Runtime	Add String.Format overloads to avoid unnecessary allocations	"It's pretty common to pass value types to `String.Format`, unfortunately this results in unnecessary boxing allocations. ## Rationale  Consider the following:  ``` c# long id = ...; int index = ...; int length = ...;  // Traditional call to String.Format string foo = string.Format(""{0}: Index = {1}, Length = {2}"", id, index, length);  // Use of the string interpolation language feature string bar = $""{id}: Index = {index}, Length = {length}""; ```  Both the traditional call to `String.Format` and the use of the string interpolation language feature (which is just syntactic sugar for `String.Format`) requires 3 boxing allocations. ## Proposed API  ``` c# namespace System {     public sealed class String : ...     {         // Proposed methods         public static string Format<T0>(string format, T0 arg0);         public static string Format<T0, T1>(string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1);         public static string Format<T0, T1, T2>(string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1, T2 arg2);         public static string Format<T0>(IFormatProvider provider, string format, T0 arg0);         public static string Format<T0, T1>(IFormatProvider provider, string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1);         public static string Format<T0, T1, T2>(IFormatProvider provider, string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1, T2 arg2);          // Existing methods         public static string Format(string format, object arg0);         public static string Format(string format, object arg0, object arg1);         public static string Format(string format, object arg0, object arg1, object arg2);         public static string Format(string format, params object[] args);         public static string Format(IFormatProvider provider, string format, object arg0);         public static string Format(IFormatProvider provider, string format, object arg0, object arg1);         public static string Format(IFormatProvider provider, string format, object arg0, object arg1, object arg2);         public static string Format(IFormatProvider provider, string format, params object[] args);          ...     } }  namespace System.Text {     public sealed class StringBuilder     {         // Proposed methods         public StringBuilder AppendFormat<T0>(string format, T0 arg0);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat<T0, T1>(string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat<T0, T1, T2>(string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1, T2 arg2);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat<T0>(IFormatProvider provider, string format, T0 arg0);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat<T0, T1>(IFormatProvider provider, string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat<T0, T1, T2>(IFormatProvider provider, string format, T0 arg0, T1 arg1, T2 arg2);          // Existing methods         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(string format, object arg0);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(string format, object arg0, object arg1);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(string format, object arg0, object arg1, object arg2);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(string format, params object[] args);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvider provider, string format, object arg0);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvider provider, string format, object arg0, object arg1);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvider provider, string format, object arg0, object arg1, object arg2);         public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvider provider, string format, params object[] args);          ...     } }  namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices {     public static class FormattableStringFactory     {         // Proposed methods         public static FormattableString Create<T0>(string format, T0 argument0);         public static FormattableString Create<T0, T1>(string format, T0 argument0, T1 argument1);         public static FormattableString Create<T0, T1, T2>(string format, T0 argument0, T1 argument1, T2 argument2);          // Existing method         public static FormattableString Create(string format, params object[] arguments);     } } ```  I'd be happy to contribute an implementation and tests.

1561	area-System.Linq	LINQ's Buffer ctor requires Count/CopyTo results be consistent	"LINQ's internal Buffer, which is used in operations like ToArray, OrderBy, Reverse, etc., assumes that if the input `IEnumerable<T>` implements `ICollection<T>`, then CopyTo will be guaranteed to copy the number of items returned previously by Count:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Enumerable.cs#L3087-L3093  ``` C# int count = 0; ICollection<TElement> collection = source as ICollection<TElement>; if (collection != null) {     count = collection.Count;     if (count > 0)     {         items = new TElement[count];         collection.CopyTo(items, 0);     } } else {     foreach (TElement item in source)     {         if (items == null)         {             items = new TElement[4];         }         else if (items.Length == count)         {             TElement[] newItems = ArrayT<TElement>.Resize(items, checked(count * 2), count);             items = newItems;         }         items[count] = item;         count++;     } } ```  This is problematic for any collection that fails this guarantee, e.g. by design the concurrent collections (`ConcurrentQueue<T>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, etc.) may have their number of elements change between the call to Count and CopyTo if elements were added or removed concurrently.  We could address this in the implementation of Buffer by avoiding the use of CopyTo, e.g.  ``` C# int count = 4; ICollection<TElement> collection = source as ICollection<TElement>; if (collection != null) {     int tmpCount = collection.Count;     if (tmpCount > 0)         count = tmpCount; } foreach (TElement item in source) {     if (items == null)     {         items = new TElement[count];     }     else if (items.Length == count)     {         TElement[] newItems = ArrayT<TElement>.Resize(items, checked(count * 2), count);         items = newItems;     }     items[count] = item;     count++; } ```  This turns Count into an estimate rather than a guarantee, avoiding the problem.  However, it has the downside of having a (potentially) less efficient copy mechanism for other `ICollection<T>` implementations, including an `IEnumerator<T>` allocation used in the foreach.  That said, it's not clear to me how often we hit the ""fast"" CopyTo path anyway; many collection types have their own ToArray method, so if the LINQ method is being used, it's likely because there are other LINQ operators in the middle, e.g. `collection.Where(...).Select(...).ToArray()`, in which case the optimization will not apply.  A few possible options: 1. We say that concurrent collections may not be used concurrently with LINQ operations.  Developers may of course already be doing this, and since you can pass concurrent collections around as `IEnumerable<T>`, the developer may not even know they're using concurrent collections but may silently either get corrupted data (e.g. the count drops after allocating the array, leaving default elements at the end of the array) or exceptions (e.g. CopyTo tries to copy more elements than the array can hold). 2. We make the above change, such that we no longer require the Count == CopyTo size guarantee, potentially special casing some known types like `List<T>`, `Collection<T>`, etc. and some known other situations, e.g. IsReadOnly returning true. 3. We special-case the known-problematic cases in the framework, namely the Concurrent\* collections, and do the second option above just for those.  We could add a marker interface or something to more easily identify them, which would also allow other collections to opt-out of such things as well. 4. ""something really cool that I don't even know about""  Thoughts? "

1571	area-System.IO	Add TextWriter.Write(string value, int index, int count) overload	TextWriter has an overload for writing a segment of a char array with this Write overload: void Write(char[] buffer, int index, int count)  But TextWriter doesn't have an overload for writing a segment of a string, e.g.: void Write(string value, int index, int count)  This means that in cases where you have a segment of a string that you want to write you either need to either substring and pass that value to Write(string) or copy the string to a char array and then use the char array segement overload.  It would be a new virtual method but the default implementation could simply call the current Write(char[] buffer, int index, int count) overload.  The main problem I see with adding Write(string, int, int) is there is a Write(string, object, object) overload that does string formatting that would be hidden. Avoid with different name?  Example of having to having to use the Write(char[] buffer, int index, int count) overload where a string overload would simplify code and improve performance: https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/blob/6a22345e28006d74c25e353b6235bc5222bab821/Src/Newtonsoft.Json/Utilities/JavaScriptUtils.cs#L220-L228

As an example I want to:  Bind to 192.168.1.101 : 1111 Allow an elastic ip with a round robin dns to be used.  In mono as example this will cause it to bind *:1111 and allow which is totally not what I wanted, there is no good way in the current api of actually specifying.   I can specify 192.168.1.101:1111/ just fine. What happens when I as well specify myroundrobindns:1111/? Do I mean that I want to allow this host header or to bind to this interface? This is where the problem starts.... What if I only specified the myroundrobindns:1111? Then it would make sense to bind all or give me an error (without IIS). But this behaviour makes it impossible to do the above (common use case).  There are literally dozens of derpy little gotchas like this (and no good way of working around them) due to how the api is laid out and not wanting to break compatibility with msclr.   Whats the plan for CoreFX?  Thoughts?  Greg 
1582	area-Infrastructure	XML test libs included in coverage report	I looked at the coverage report and noticed that a bunch of XML test libs are included:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1376924/7392228/d392bf42-ee86-11e4-8254-db6d5ee5e20f.png)  Those are dragging the overall coverage down and should be excluded from coverage.  /cc @krwq  
1583	area-System.Runtime	Add generic overloads to Math.Min and Math.Max	There are overloads of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` for all the numeric types, but there aren't any for general comparable types (including framework types like `DateTime` and `TimeSpan`). It would be nice to have them. ## Rationale  For integral types, `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` are not necessary, e.g. instead of `Math.Min(a, b)`, you can write `a <= b ? a : b`. But they are nice, because they make the meaning clear and decrease the likelihood of error. The same argument applies to general comparable types, so they should work with `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` too. ## Proposed API  ``` c# public static class Math {     public static T Min<T>(T val1, T val2) where T : IComparable<T>;     public static T Min<T>(T val1, T val2, IComparer<T> comparer);      public static T Max<T>(T val1, T val2) where T : IComparable<T>;     public static T Max<T>(T val1, T val2, IComparer<T> comparer); } ``` ## Open questions - Should the constraint `where T : IComparable<T>` be there? Other framework methods that require comparison, like `Enumerable.OrderBy`, don't have it and instead use `Comparer<T>.Default`. - Should nullable value types be supported? The proposed version doesn't, because `T?` does not implement `IComparable<T?>`, even when `T` does implement `IComparable<T>`.

1591	area-System.Reflection	System.Reflection.Metadata.MetadataReader.MetadataReader consistently throws InvalidOperationException in store app	I'm able to use System.Reflection.Metadata without any problems in my .NET 4.5.1 desktop app, but I'm unable to successfully use it in a Windows Store app--I consistently see this exception getting thrown:  ``` System.InvalidOperationException occurred Message: Exception thrown: 'System.InvalidOperationException' in mscorlib.ni.dll Additional information: The API 'System.Text.Encoding.GetString(Byte*, Int32)' cannot be used on the current platform.

1593	area-System.Xml	XPathNodeIterator should implement IEnumerable<XPathNavigator>	Currently XPathNodeIterator implements only IEnumerable interface. XPathNodeIterator always iterates over objects of type XPathNavigator and thus every usage ends up with casting back and forth XPathNavigator --> object --> XPathNavigator in a loop. Implementing IEnumerable<XPathNavigator> on this type would allow to avoid this indirection and in cases where iterating is useful improve perf.    cc: @tmat    EDIT 2017/12/28: In PR: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/26083    Requested API changes:    ```diff  namespace System.Xml.XPath  {  ...  -    public abstract class XPathNodeIterator : ICloneable, IEnumerable  +    public abstract class XPathNodeIterator : ICloneable, IEnumerable<XPathNavigator>  ...  ```  
1595	area-System.Xml	Add XmlReader.ResetState to enable pooling	(modified copy of internal bug / cc: @tmat) The XmlReader allocates char[] and byte[] buffers in its ParseState.  XmlReader created via XmlReader.Create doesn't expose ResetState method that would allow pooling.  XmlTextReader does, however the class is legacy and not available on new platforms (in portable profile).  Or in simple words: put multiple xml files in one stream and try to parse it without creating multiple XmlReader instances which do a lot of allocations.  Simple scenario is reading xml doc comments by Roslyn 
1596	area-System.Globalization	Randomized Hashing APIs	Proposal is to add APIs which expose old hashing methods and the new one (old ones are non randomized).  Background: On some platforms default is to use randomized hashing and on some it is non randomized. Exposing APIs allows devs to make it explicit so in case we want to always use randomized hashing for security reasons we can do it or if we want the hashing to be faster we can use non randomized.  (Some work might need to be done in dotnet/coreclr)  This was already reviewed internally once although here is another iteration. Proposal is to add following APIs  ``` csharp //assembly System.Globalization {     namespace System.Globalization {         public class CompareInfo {             public virtual int GetHashCode(string source, CompareOptions options, HashingOption hashingOption);         }         // enum numbers should be explicit in the final version         public enum HashingOption {             //Default, ???             NonRandomized,             Randomized,         }     } //}  //assembly System.Globalization.Extensions {     namespace System.Globalization {         public static class GlobalizationExtensions {             public static StringComparer GetStringComparer(this CompareInfo compareInfo, CompareOptions options, HashingOption hashingOption);         }     } //}  //assembly System.Runtime.Extensions {     namespace System {         public abstract class StringComparer : IComparer, IComparer<string>, IEqualityComparer, IEqualityComparer<string> {             public static StringComparer OrdinalNonRandomized { get; }             public static StringComparer OrdinalIgnoreCaseNonRandomized { get; }             public static StringComparer OrdinalRandomized { get; }             public static StringComparer OrdinalIgnoreCaseRandomized { get; }         }     } //} ``` 
1597	area-Infrastructure	Running CoreFx tests from VS is broken	Im using TestDriven.NET. 1)  Right-click on a test method and selecting Run Test works well for System.Reflection.Metadata tests. Good. 2)  Right-click on a test class or a test file reports an error in output: The target type doesn't contain tests from a known test framework or a 'Main' method. 3)  Right-click on a test method and selecting Test with  Debugger freezes VS.  Test Explorer doesnt show any tests even after full solution build.  Trying to set the test project as a startup project and F5 it.  Error: The working directory does not exist: 'C:\FX0\bin\tests\Windows_NT.AnyCPU.Debug\System.Reflection.Metadata.Tests\dnxcore50'.  Seems like building the entire CoreFx repo fixes this issue (although Im not quite sure). In any case I dont want to build the entire repo to run a single test.  Couldnt get F5 work from Dev12 VS, yet the project is Dev12 VS. With Dev14 I was able to debug the test. 
1598	area-Meta	Improve layout of bin\tests directory	Building and running all CoreFx tests creates bin\tests directory with an insane amount of files (14493 files of total size 1.4GB). The problem is that every CoreFx library deploys its own copy of DNX and XUnit (175 files) to its test directory. Instead all tests should be deployed into a single directory with a single copy of DNX. 
1603	area-Meta	Add inner and outer loop testing explanation to Developer Guide	
1605	area-System.Numerics	Add Conversions methods to Vector<T>	It would be useful to support conversions between different types of Vector<T>.  The API and usage model is pretty straightforward for same-size types, e.g. Double and Int64, so I would suggest that we start by exposing that, and consider mixed-size converts as usage demands (we have had customer requests for at least the same-size convert).  A possible instance method on Vector<T> might look like this:     public Vector<Double> ToVectorDouble(); and it would throw arg exception for non-64-bit vectors (or, alternatively, it could be defined as an extension method on the static Vector class for only those instantiations that are supported).  I propose the following: - `Vector<Double> <=> Vector<Int64>` - `Vector<Double> <=> Vector<UInt64>` - `Vector<Single> <=> Vector<Int32>` - `Vector<Single> <=> Vector<UInt32>` 
1608	area-System.Numerics	Add Gather methods for Vector<T>	Vector Gathers are a commonly used paradigm in vector computation - where a gather involves constructing a vector from non-contiguous elements of a source array.  Gather is supported on AVX2, but even on targets that do not directly support it, such a method would be useful, in order to avoid the overhead of having to use an array to hold the elements prior to contructing the Vector.    VectorGather should perhaps be declared on the static Vector class, something like:      `public static Vector<T> VectorGather(T[] source, Vector<U> indexVector) where T,U : struct`    Initially, I think it would be reasonable to support only same/size convert and gather  but eventually we may want to consider mixed size (e.g. a gather to a Vector<Double> using the lower values of a Vector<Int32>.  AVX2 has a pretty rich mixture of these.    @mellinoe what do you think?

1611	area-System.Net	 HttpResponseHeader should have a Cookies property	Hello, The HttpResponseHeader class (found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Headers/HttpResponseHeaders.cs ) doesn't seem to include a standard and pretty trivial header, the Cookies header.  Furthermore, as suggested by http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/advanced/http-cookies, we should use the HttpResponseHeadersExtensions, found at https://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#src/System.Net.Http.Formatting/HttpResponseHeadersExtensions.cs , however, as you can see in the code (and in the CookieHeaderValue class) - there's no way to configure default values, e.g. HttpOnly or Secured.  In a regular ASP.NET website we can set the default values in web.config, but since ASP.NET WebAPI doesn't rely on that, there's no way, even in the WebAPI configuration registering method to set such values.  Part from creating my own extension to add cookies with default values, I would suggest adding support for cookies in the HttpResponseHeaders class and having the option to set default values in registration time.  Thank you very much. 
1612	area-System.Data	System.Data.SqlClient.SqlParameter Precision and Scale do not work via the abstract API	"Package from dnxcore50 via  ``` ""System.Data.SqlClient"": ""4.0.0-beta-*"", ```  This works:  ``` SqlParameter p = ... p.Precision = 10; p.Scale = 5; ```  However, if instead we use the abstract base class (like most tools will be):  ``` SqlParameter p = ... DbParameter d = p; d.Precision = 10; d.Scale = 5; ```  then all of `p.Precision`, `p.Scale`, `d.Precision`, `d.Scale` **remain at 0**, and consequently do not work correctly.  The abstract API's `Scale` and `Precision` (and any other associated members) should mirror the concrete type's equivalent.  This code is not in corefx yet, so I cannot fix it :( "
1613	area-System.Data	System.Data.SqlClient does not allow enum parameters values (it does in .NET)	"Is this an expected break?  For example:  ```     using (var cmd = connection.CreateCommand())     {         cmd.CommandText = ""select @foo"";         cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@foo"", AnEnum.B);         object value = cmd.ExecuteScalar();         AnEnum val = (AnEnum)value; // cheeky unbox behavior         val.IsEqualTo(AnEnum.B);     }      enum AnEnum     {         A = 2,         B = 1     } ```  In .NET this works fine; in CoreCLR this breaks on the `ExecuteScalar()` call, reporting an `ArgumentException` with text:  > No mapping exists from object type AnEnum to a known managed provider native type. "
1616	area-System.Numerics	bug: Vector<long> extracting components with a literal leads to incorrect code gen.	It appears that if you try to retrieve components of a `Vector<T>` with a constant something wrong is occurring and an incorrect code is generated. This does not happen when extracting to an array, or when you use a variable (like say through a for-loop). This only happens when you extract literal components.  Here is a simple reproduction.  This happened in VS2015 RC  ``` csharp          static bool TestLiterals(Vector<long> vl)         {             var v = vl[0];             var v1 = vl[1];             var v2 = vl[2];             var v3 = vl[3];             return v != 0 || v1 != 0 || v2 != 0 || v3 != 0;          }         static bool TestLoop(Vector<long> vl)         {             for(int i=0; i < Vector<long>.Count; i++)             {                 var v = vl[i];                 if (v != 0) return true;             }             return false;         }         static void Main(string[] args)         {             var array = new long[4] { 0, 0, 0, 1 };             var vector = new Vector<long>(array);             Console.WriteLine(Vector<long>.Count);             Console.WriteLine(TestLiterals(vector));             Console.WriteLine(TestLoop(vector));         } ```  On my i5 broadwell chip it printed:  ``` 4 False True ```  This is very much the wrong result. The correct answer should be:  ``` 4 True True ```  It's pretty easy to see that both methods should yield the same result. Here is the assembly of the `testliteral` And the error becomes obvious.  ``` **00007FFB1E086E20  vmovupd     ymm0,ymmword ptr [rcx]   00007FFB1E086E25  vmovd       rax,xmm0  ** **00007FFB1E086E2A  vmovupd     ymm0,ymmword ptr [rcx]   00007FFB1E086E2F  vmovaps     ymm1,ymm0   00007FFB1E086E34  vpsrldq     ymm1,ymm1,8   00007FFB1E086E3A  vmovd       rdx,xmm1  ** 00007FFB1E086E3F  vmovupd     ymm0,ymmword ptr [rcx]   00007FFB1E086E44  vmovaps     ymm1,ymm0   00007FFB1E086E49  vpsrldq     ymm1,ymm1,10h   00007FFB1E086E4F  vmovd       r8,xmm1   00007FFB1E086E54  vmovupd     ymm0,ymmword ptr [rcx]   00007FFB1E086E59  vmovaps     ymm1,ymm0   00007FFB1E086E5E  vpsrldq     ymm1,ymm1,18h   00007FFB1E086E64  vmovd       rcx,xmm1   00007FFB1E086E69  or          rax,rdx   00007FFB1E086E6C  or          rax,r8   00007FFB1E086E6F  test        rax,rax   00007FFB1E086E72  jne         00007FFB1E086E7E   ```  The input vector is in `ymm0` and it is using `ymm1` as its scratch buffer, first copying and then shifting the register by the offset but is trying to pull the component out of `xmm1`!  It appears that the compiler while having some concept of AVX registers, is still confused.  
1617	area-System.Numerics	Vector<T> should allow variable length based size of available registers.	Currently, it seems that `Vector<T>` will always be the size of the largest available register, and has no support for using a smaller register. E.g. if you have AVX2, you currently can only build `Vector<T>` of 256bit. For some algorithms it can be very useful to be able to use either a vector of size 16 or a vector of size 32.  
1622	area-Infrastructure	Consider open sourcing ApiCompat.	Internally we have some tooling to ensure that implementation assemblies are compatible with contracts.  It would be a good idea to open source that and use it as part of the build or CI system or something.  I'm not sure if this will happen naturally when we actually start generating contracts in the open or if we'll need to take extra steps. 
1624	area-System.Net	An simple way to mock an httpClient.GetAsync(..) method for unit tests?	`System.Net.Http` has now been uploaded to the repo :smile: :tada: :balloon:   Whenever I've used this in some service, it works great but makes it hard to unit test => my unit tests don't want to actually ever hit that real end point.  Ages ago, I asked @davidfowl what should we do? I hoping I paraphrase and don't misquote him - but he suggested that I need to fake up a message handler (ie. `HttpClientHandler`), wire that up, etc.   As such, I ended up making a helper library called [HttpClient.Helpers](https://github.com/PureKrome/HttpClient.Helpers) to help me run my unit tests.  So this works ... but it feels _very_ messy and .. complicated. I'm sure I'm not the first person that needs to make sure my unit tests don't do a real call to an external service.  Is there an easier way? Like .. can't we just have an `IHttpClient` interface and we can inject that into our service? 
1625	area-System.Runtime	"[public api] System.Runtime.Environment - OSName(""FreeBSD"") or OSName(""BSD"")"	"This issue is to discuss what the final identifier will be within the entire public API surface and what will be the build target identifier that msbuild will use.  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1576 started the discussion of wether to use `OSName(""FreeBSD"")` vs `OSName(""BSD"")` in the unit tests and is recommended reading before progressing with reading this issue. `FreeBSD` won but it can be easily refactored due to being a non-public contract.  The BSD's (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/DragonFlyBSD) unlike Linux all have different kernels so potentially it might be required to split them out as separate platforms. This might be completely unnecessary whereby the additional BSD's may just work as a direct result of the port team's efforts. There are enough differences between the different BSDs that it could be needed to differentiate between them however.  We have some time before a decision needs to be cemented in as there is a more pressing issue as mentioned by @stephentoub and registered as issue #1626  > There's what's likely a more pressing issue, which is actually building for FreeBSD. Today, when we need to specialize an assembly for a particular platform, we effectively have three builds, producing three different managed assemblies: Windows, Linux, OSX. Sounds like at least for now we'll need a fourth, FreeBSD. I suggest you start by modifying the build to support an IsFreeBSD property (or just IsBSD of you think there's a high chance that the implementations across BSDs will be the same even with varied kernels) along with the appropriate OSGroup targets. That can then be used in the csproj files as needed to specialize an assembly with FreeBSD-specific code.  I feel uneasy about using either `OSName(""FreeBSD"")` (platform fragmentation) or `OSName(""BSD"")` (too generic) with the amount of information available at this point in time but obviously a direction needs to be chosen.   @janhenke @josteink (core members of the portteam) have put forward on multiple times that they would prefer `FreeBSD` and I have no strong preferences in any which direction as long as the _future_ implications are considered carefully because this decision affects the public API surface.  Ultimately advice, direction and a decision will be needed by MSFT on this matter.  note: issue was edited/refactored based on feedback from josenink since original post. "
1626	area-Meta	Support for FreeBSD	## Updated proposal from 2017/9    Proposal (by @karelz - https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1626#issuecomment-329840518) will be updated in top-post based on further discussion and proposal changes.    We discussed community-driven port for FreeBSD with @RussellHaley (from FreeBSD community) and @wfurt (from .NET Core team) who both expressed interest in the work.  Here's a plan proposal we put together (feedback / suggestions are welcome):    1. Produce binaries in CoreCLR & CoreFX repo targeting FreeBSD - using hacks is fine      * Hard to parallelize, @wfurt will work on that      * The build can be mix of builds from other platforms (Mac, Linux) targeting FreeBSD      * We will need documented steps (on FreeBSD wiki) to reproduce the build with FreeBSD-specific bug fixes  2. Run & stabilize CoreCLR tests (using corerun)      * Tests may be built on another platform      * Goal: Provides basic quality of runtime  3. Run & stabilize CoreFX tests (using corerun)      * Tests may be built on another platform      * Note this requires xunit. We believe, based on our past porting experience, once [2] is done, xunit will just work.      * This can be in theory parallelized with [2] - it may require shortcutting xunit (e.g. generate static execution recipe on another platform)      * We can expose new OSPlatform API for FreeBSD when the pass rate is reasonable: see #23989  4. Full stack build on FreeBSD (using corerun as bootstrapper from [1]-[3])      * We will need all tools (nuget, msbuild, roslyn) to work on boostrapping .NET Core  5. Installers (FreeBSD ports)      * First-stage: Using product binaries from nuget feeds      * Second-stage: Build product from source (blocked on build from source effort)      * Requires FreeBSD community expertise and guidance on design      * Note: We can link FreeBSD packages also from official .NET Core download pages as community-support packages  6. Regular build and test runs on FreeBSD      * Goal: Make sure changes in .NET Core repos breaking FreeBSD are known early      * Design needed      * Requires FreeBSD community expertise and guidance on design    Operation principles:  * Changes in [2]-[4] should be done primarily in CoreCLR/CoreFX repos (due to CLA signing requirements, code reviews from .NET Core team experts/members. etc.)  * We will track high-level work on this issue. Specific bugs will be filed as separate issues.    If anyone is interested in helping, please let us know here. We can easily distribute work items from [2] & [3] above once we are far enough with [1].    ---------------------------------------------    ## Original proposal from @ghuntley from 2015/5    This issue is to discuss unit(s) of work to actually produce FreeBSD assemblies for corefx.      > @stephentoub - There's what's likely a more pressing issue, which is actually building for FreeBSD.

1633	area-System.Reflection	More offsets in MetadataReader	I believe MetadataReader should have more APIs which tell me about offsets.  I. e.: Let's say I'm writing strong name signer, there are few steps required (assuming that assembly is already delayed signed): - calculate hash, - sign hash, - inject signature  to calculate hash you need to skip some parts of the PE file like: - strong name signature blob (including the 8 bytes in the header) - certificates blob (including 8 bytes header) - checksum  so I need to have offsets and sizes for each of those. For blobs there are already APIs: i.e.:  ``` peReader.PEHeaders.CorHeader.StrongNameSignatureDirectory.Size peReader.PEHeaders.CorHeader.StrongNameSignatureDirectory.RelativeVirtualAddress peReader.PEHeaders.PEHeader.CertificateTableDirectory.Size peReader.PEHeaders.PEHeader.CertificateTableDirectory.RelativeVirtualAddress ```  what is missing is: - checksum offset (and optionally a size) - blob headers  for blob headers we can do simple change in System.Reflection.PortableExecutable.DirectoryEntry which is:  ``` diff     public struct DirectoryEntry     { //... +       public readonly int HeaderOffset; //...         internal DirectoryEntry(ref PEBinaryReader reader)         { +           HeaderOffset = reader.CurrentOffset;             RelativeVirtualAddress = reader.ReadInt32();             Size = reader.ReadInt32();         } //...     } ```  For stuff like CheckSum offset we need something like this:  ``` diff     public sealed class PEHeader     { //... +       public int BaseOffset; // this might be always 0 so const would be fine too //... +       public const int CheckSumOffset; +       public const int CheckSumSize; +       //etc. for other fields } ```  cc: @nguerrera @tmat  What are your thoughts?

A possible solution is to either add a defaulted bool parameter to each/some of the constructors (bool emitBOM = True), or add a new enum e.g. StreamWriterOptions with EmitBOM as one of the enums and again having that enum as a defaulted parameter on each/some of the constructors.

1665	area-System.Reflection	Vague/invalid Strong Name Signing description in ECMA-335	ECMA-335 description of strong name signing (II.6.2.1.3): -  To calculate the hash, the signature is zeroed, the hash calculated, and then the result is stored into the signature. - The Strong Name (SN) signing process uses standard hash and cipher algorithms for Strong name signing. An SHA-1 hash over most of the PE file is generated. That hash value is RSA-signed with the SN private key. For verification purposes the public key is stored into the PE file as well as the signed hash value. - Except for the following, all portions of the PE File are hashed:   - The Authenticode Signature entry: PE files can be authenticode signed. The authenticode signature is contained in the 8-byte entry at offset 128 of the PE Header Data Directory (Certificate Table in II.25.2.3.3) and the contents of the PE File in the range specified by this directory entry.  [Note: In a PE File conforming to this specification, this entry shall be zero. end note]   - The Strong Name Blob: The 8-byte entry at offset 32 of the CLI Header (StrongNameSignature in II.25.3.3) and the contents of the hash data contained at this RVA in the PE File. If the 8-byte entry is 0, there is no associated strong name signature.   - The PE Header Checksum: The 4-byte entry at offset 64 of the PE Header Windows NT-Specific Fields (File Checksum in II.25.2.3.2). [Note: In a PE File conforming to this specification, this entry shall be zero. end note]  What we actually do is (hashing): - In CorHeader/CLI Header set StrongNameSigned flag (value: 8). (I believe this is starting on 12th byte of CLI Header and is UInt32 - do not remove the old flag value just do bitwise OR with value 8) - Set Checksum (4 bytes) to zeros (this is in optional PE header in NT specific fields) - Set Certificate Directory entry (only 8 byte header) to zeros - Calculate hash of PE header from the start until sections headers are finished. Notes: - Continue hashing each section in the order of occurrence in the headers (this will start immediately after section headers and will intentionally skip padding after section headers). Note:   - Strong Name Directory - entirely skip from hashing (but do hash its data directory 8 byte header as is)  After we get a hash we sign it and store in Strong Name Directory

The original fix for the issue (which introduced this jumping into another thread goo) had this comment:  > On 64-bit platforms the ControlC handler is executed on a thread created > outside the runtime with very small stack. Our SO checking now > conservatively checks for space, which leaves insufficient space to > allow an exception to be thrown and caught.  >  > The change is to launch the user event on a ThreadPool thread instead of > in the ControlC handler thread.

We have given up on it since then.

Consider the scenario where one constructs an instance of the Uri class with the path ""www.domain.com"". As expected, this evaluates to a relative path, because the protocol has not been specified. However, absolute or not, one would expect the value of its Uri.HostNameType to be UriHostNameType.Dns. Instead, checking the HostNameType throws an exception.  This particular scenario also exhibits an inconsistency with other members of the Uri class. Uri.CheckHostName(string name) is a static method which returns a UriHostNameType value, just the same as the Uri.HostNameType instance property. One could reasonably expect the following two calls to return the same value:  var hostType = new Uri(""www.domain.com"", UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute).HostNameType; var hostType = Uri.CheckHostName(""www.domain.com"");  Unfortunately, the first call throws an exception.

Enumerables throwing an exception during `GetEnumerator()` will expose the original exception, and won't wrap it in `AggregateException` (which at least a nave reading of the documentation suggests it should), for everything but the following 'output' methods: - `Average` - `Count` - `LongCount` - `Max` - `Min` - `Sum`  ... and `SequenceEqual`, but only when some other method is called first (eg, `new FailingEnumerable.AsParallel().Select(x => x).SequenceEquals(b)`).  If the enumerator itself throws an exception (from `MoveNext()` or `Current`), and additional PLINQ method is called first: 1. `SequenceEqual` throws nested `AggregateException`s 2. The following 'output' methods throw the original exception, and will not wrap it in an `AggregateException`:    - `Aggregate(seed, accumulator)`    - `Aggregate(seed, accumulator, resultSelector)`    - `foreach(...)`    - `ToArray`    - `ToDictionary`    - `ToList`  This is, at minimum, a 'gotcha' waiting to trip somebody up.  How should we handle it? Interestingly, `SequenceEqual` has:  > // If first.GetEnumerator throws an exception, we don't want to wrap it with an AggregateException. >    // If second.GetEnumerator throws an exception, we don't want to wrap it with an AggregateException.  ... which I have a feeling was to deal with the case where an inner operator threw something already wrapped (to not nest it), but ended up missing the other cases.  <hr />  I've got a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Clockwork-Muse/c10553dbce3de937aecd) of the tests I'm using to find this info, although I wasn't planning on adding them to the PLINQ tests in this form.  Especially because some stuff has been ad-hoc tweaked to be able to find the info better

1849	area-System.IO	Unix: Why not use Unix Domain Sockets for Named Pipes?	System.IO.Pipes map to native windows implementations of anonymous and named pipes.  Windows anonymous are close in implementation to Unix pipes in that they are one way and byte oriented (not datagram or message oriented).  On the other hand, Named pipes can be either full (supporting I/O in both directions) or half (I/O in one direction) and messages can either be byte oriented or message/datagram oriented.   Pipe connections can also be made across systems through the network (I believe using SMB)  Unix has named pipes called FiFo's but they are one way only and not message oriented.  The current Pipes port for corefx under unix uses FIfo's and therefore is a subset implementation.  Instead of using Fifo's why don't we use Unix Domain Sockets?  They support most of the functionality of windows named pipes including full/half duplex, byte or message oriented.  They however don't support cross system connections.   see overview of Unix Domain Sockets here:  http://www.thomasstover.com/uds.html  Ultimately, what is the goal of the corefx library on a different platform?  To bind to existing similar functionality? or to provide strict portability of the api's across platforms (what I'm calling emulation)?  If we strictly bind, then there will always be limitations and differences on functionality provided thus decreasing portability.  However by binding, we are hooking into existing OS capabilities and can in theory hook up to other non-net apps on the host platform.  If we strictly emulate (e.g. say grab a chunk of shared memory and then using semaphores to strictly emulate named pipes functionality under Unix), then we can be extremely portable however we can't communicate with anything else.  A possible solution is to extend what can be used as a 'pipe name' in the system.io.pipes implementation where the syntax can be extended to give hints as to what to bind to in the underlying implementation but with the default (without any extended syntax) defaulting to an emulated functional solution.  Comments?

1861	area-Infrastructure	Linux tests fail in CI due to mscorlib.ni.dll existing.	Linux test runs in CI have been failing (silently) for a while with execute assembly errors.  This started around here:  http://dotnet-ci.cloudapp.net/job/dotnet_corefx_linux_debug_tst/264/  Which had these changes:  Update to latest CoreFx packages (commit: 08c0d8628ef621fbd44d7aaa85b3239616a6b108) Move DNU/Roslyn forward (commit: 804b4330a6ae767694cf89ebd173533b539f16f5)  The problem looks to be due to the fact that we are now copying mscorlib.ni.dll into the test folder.  This is not a Linux native image so things blow up when we try to load and run it.  To unblock things, I am adding some logic to run-tests.sh to just delete the native images, but that's not the right long term thing (especially with crossgen support coming real soon now).  We need to stop this incorrect native image from being deployed, and eventually deploy the right one.  This issue tracks doing the right thing.  Once fixed, we should remove the code in run-test.sh that's tagged with this issue number.

For details and and a implementation sample see my post: https://petermeinl.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/tamed-filesystemwatcher/  Average programmers (for which we should make life as easy as reasonable) often are often not even aware of having to implement an OnError event handler resulting in InternalBufferOverflowExceptions going unnoticed and FSW being perceived as unreliable.

1883	area-System.Numerics	Buffer too small in BigIntegerCalculator.Divide	We are seeing some memory corruption after a recent change to biginteger.divide. This is what I got from an engineer investigating the issue:  I was able to repro this bug and find its cause. The bug is in System.Runtime.Numerics.dll, introduced by change #1476305 on 5/23. There is an array overflow in unsafe C# code that does division of BigInteger, in System.Numerics.BigIntegerCalculator.Divide(UInt32_, Int32, UInt32_, Int32, UInt32_, Int32, UInt32_, Int32) in FxCore/Open/src/System.Runtime.Numerics/src/System/Numerics/BigIntegerCalculator.DivRem.cs. This method allocates a few arrays:  ```         fixed (uint* dividend = new uint[dividendLength],                      divisor = new uint[divisorLength],                      guess = new uint[divisorLength]) ```  The guess array is used as the destination of a multiplication:                         MultiplyDivisor(divisor, divisorLength, digit, guess);  This multiplies an array of length divisorLength with an uint. The result length is divisorLength+1, longer than the memory allocated for guess. This overwrites the sync block of the next item in memory, causing asserts later on.  Increasing the allocation of guess by 1 should fix this bug. 
1891	area-Meta	What are the rules on adding new APIs to CoreFX?	I saw this: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1017#issuecomment-107752252.   > To expose the RuntimeEnvironment class, it requires updation to the desktop api, which will not come to effect until next desktop release. Hence, the portable version cannot be released, before the desktop 4.6.1 is released, to ensure this contract works on all platforms, which is the same problem we had with PlatformID, we want to decouple ourselves from desktop dependencies and be more quick with releases.  What are the rules that are proposed for updating .NET Core? There are at least a few scenarios: - Adding new members on a type that exists in the .NET Framework. - Adding new types that represent a similar concept that exists in the .NET Framework - Adding new types (new concepts) that do not exist in the .NET Framework.  Ideally, we could update .NET Core at the pace we want. Is the issue that we might add one new member to a type that is represented in contract foo and doing so would make contract foo incompatible with .NET Framework vLatest?  /cc @Priya91, @terrajobst, @davidfowl

1942	area-System.Collections	Proposal: Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.TryAdd(TKey, TValue)	It's very common to see code that does this:  ``` C# Dictionary<TKey, TValue> data = ...; ... if (!data.ContainsKey(key))     data.Add(key, value); ```  This forces the dictionary to lookup the key twice when the key isn't yet in the dictionary.  It'd be great if we had an additional method on the type:  ``` C# public bool TryAdd(TKey key, TValue value); ```  Functionally it would behave exactly as if it were implemented like:  ``` C# public bool TryAdd(TKey key, TValue value) {     if (ContainsKey(key)) return false;     Add(key, value);     return true; } ```  but the implementation internally would be done more efficiently, essentially implemented by calling a variant of Insert but that returns false instead of throwing when a duplicate key is found.

EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new should allocate the memory and call (OpenSSL) EVP_CIPHER_CTX_init, and have a well-defined free.  If gymnastics are required for checking this in, a followup issue to use the new method should be filed.  If the native library has moved to dotnet/corefx by the time this is done, then the managed code to consume it should potentially be part of the same change.

1967	area-System.Collections	[Proposal] IImmutableSet<T>.Union should handle duplicates like ISet<T>.UnionWith	The [`ISet<T>.UnionWith`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd411713.aspx) method is documented to handle duplicates as follows:  > ``` cs > void UnionWith(IEnumerable<T> other) > ``` >  > Any duplicate elements in _other_ are ignored.  The [`Enumerable.Union`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb341731.aspx) extension method documents an even stronger condition:  > ``` cs > public static IEnumerable<TSource> Union<TSource>(this IEnumerable<TSource> first, IEnumerable<TSource> second) > ``` >  > When the object returned by this method is enumerated, `Union` enumerates _first_ and _second_ in that order and yields each element that has not already been yielded.  The `IImmutableSet<T>.Union` method appears to provide the same functionality as the above method, but does not specify the behavior of the result with respect to duplicate elements. In the current implementation of `ImmutableSortedSet<T>`, the `Union` operation behavior varies depending on the relative size of the `this` and `other` sequences. This could be confusing for users expecting the elements of the `this` sequence to take precedence.  I propose defining the behavior with respect to duplicates partially (to match `ISet<T>.UnionWith`) or fully (to match `Enumerable.Union<TSource>`), and updating the implementation of `ImmutableSortedSet<T>` to follow the new behavior.

Between the two 1.8Gb in allocations in 60 seconds.  The root is that DefrateStream will create on every construction (1 per request) an Infrater (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.IO.Compression/src/System/IO/Compression/DeflateStream.cs#L62) and the Infrater will also build an OutputWindow (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.IO.Compression/src/System/IO/Compression/OutputWindow.cs). Which in turn will allocate 32Kb to use as a buffer for each request.   Reusing those buffers and/or OutputWindow would aleviate a lot the allocation stress GZipStream causes when used in small streams contexts like Web APIs.

A more marginal case would be that ""00FZ00"" becomes `{ 0x00, 0xFF, 0x00 }`, which could cause some interesting wrong matches for things like FindBySerialNumber.

For the following names, an array of struct kinfo_proc structures    is returned, whose size depends on the current number of such    objects in the system.         Third level name      Fourth level is:      KERN_PROC_ALL         None      KERN_PROC_PID         A process ID      KERN_PROC_PGRP        A process group      KERN_PROC_TTY         A tty device      KERN_PROC_UID         A user ID      KERN_PROC_RUID        A real user ID       If the third level name is KERN_PROC_ARGS then the command line    argument array is returned in a flattened form, i.e., zero-termi-    nated arguments follow each other.  The total size of array is    returned.  It is also possible for a process to set its own    process title this way.  If the third level name is    KERN_PROC_PATHNAME, the path of the process' text file is stored.    For KERN_PROC_PATHNAME, a process ID of -1 implies the current    process.

2075	area-System.Linq	Append/Prepend	"## Summary  Two of the IEnumerable extension methods that I carry in my collection (we all have a personal collection of IEnumerable extension methods, am I right?) are Append and Prepend, for adding a single element to the end or beginning of a sequence respectively. Though not quite as common as concatenating sequences, I have been surprised at how often this need arises. Doing this inside of an expression today is not straightforward; the best equivalent that I have found is far from ideal:  ``` sequence.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat(singleValue, 1)) ```  I propose adding Prepend and Append extension methods to Enumerable to fill this need. ## API  ``` public static class Enumerable {     public static IEnumerable<T> Append<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, T value);     public static IEnumerable<T> Prepend<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, T value) } ``` ## Usage  ``` optionalValues.Prepend(""<None>"") ``` "
2076	area-System.Linq	Sorting sequences	## Summary  There are two scenarios where the existing Enumerable OrderBy methods are not ideal: - When sorting a sequence of comparable values (e.g. ints). In this case an identify function must be provided as the key selector: `ints.Sort(x => x)` - When sorting on something other than a single key, an identity function must be provided to select the element as the key, AND an instance of IComparer must be provided, which is at odds with the majority of LINQ methods which take functions (and are therefore easier to use with lambda expressions):  ``` using NodaTime; using NodaTime.TimeZones; ... IEnumerable<DateTimeZone> tzs = ...; var tzEqComparer = new ZoneEqualityComparer(); tzs = tzs.OrderBy(x => x, Comparer<DateTimeZone>.Create((tz1, tz2) => tzEqComparer.Equals(tz1, tz2) ? 0 : tz1.Id.CompareTo(tz2.Id)); ```  I propose adding various overloads of Sort to address these situations. The name Sort is chosen specifically to distinguish these methods, which do not take a key selector, from the OrderBy methods, which do. If this is not considered an important distinction, the names could be changed to OrderBy without colliding with the existing methods. ## API  ``` public static class Enumerable {     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> Sort<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source) where T : IComparable<T>     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> Sort<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, IComparer<T> comparer)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> Sort<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, Comparison<T> comparison)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> SortDescending<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source) where T : IComparable<T>     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> SortDescending<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, IComparer<T> comparer)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> SortDescending<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, Comparison<T> comparison)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> ThenSort<T>(this IOrderedEnumerable<T> source) where T : IComparable<T>     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> ThenSort<T>(this IOrderedEnumerable<T> source, IComparer<T> comparer)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> ThenSort<T>(this IOrderedEnumerable<T> source, Comparison<T> comparison)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> ThenSortDescending<T>(this IOrderedEnumerable<T> source) where T : IComparable<T>     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> ThenSortDescending<T>(this IOrderedEnumerable<T> source, IComparer<T> comparer)     public static IOrderedEnumerable<T> ThenSortDescending<T>(this IOrderedEnumerable<T> source, Comparison<T> comparison) } ``` ## Usage  ``` ints.Sort() ```  ``` using NodaTime; using NodaTime.TimeZones; ... IEnumerable<DateTimeZone> tzs = ...; var tzEqComparer = new ZoneEqualityComparer(); tzs = tzs.Sort((tz1, tz2) => tzEqComparer.Equals(tz1, tz2) ? 0 : tz1.Id.CompareTo(tz2.Id)); ``` ## Questions 1. The generic restriction to IComparable<T> is not necessary if the implementation will delegate to OrderBy with an identity function (although there are other potential implementations). However, even if not strictly necessary, it clearly expresses the intent of the method. Is there a downside to keeping it? 2. Overloads that take an IComparer are included for parity with OrderBy. Between the two, I prefer the overload that takes the Comparison, since converting an IComparer into a Comparison<T> is more straightforward than going the other way. However, I am not aware of the rationale behind using IComparer instead of Comparison in the OrderBy methods. We should consider whether the same rationale applies to Sort, or whether it might make sense to remove the IComparer overloads to reduce the API surface. 3. Should the OrderBy methods have overloads added that take Comparison for parity? Or is there something about the usage pattern of selecting a key that makes it less likely that a comparison function will be provided inline? (This is the inverse of question 2). 4. What about Queryable?

2081	area-Serialization	Update NetCore DCJS to use the same code with NetNative DCJS	DCJS implementation in NetCore at the moment is based on the JavascriptSerializer/Deserializer which is rather different from the ones used in NetNative and on Desktop. This introduces unneccessary effort in making improvement and providing consistent behaviors. This change switches DCJS in NetCore to the same code that is used in NetNative with MERGE_DCJS directive. If there is no issues I will follow to clean up this directive and unused code.  @SGuyGe @zhenlan @roncain @shmao  
2085	area-Serialization	Fix serialization of generic queue to align with NetNative	Generic queue is serialized differently in NetCore compared to NetNative since it skips the queue's _syncRoot property of type object.  This change is to fix the behavior when serializing property of type object in general.  As Serialization of generic queue on desktop is controlled with Serializable, NonSerialized attributes, which are not available in NetCore, this results in a different load compared to desktop. I have verified that cross platform serialization/deserialization works fine.  cc: @SGuyGe @zhenlan @shmao  
2093	area-System.ComponentModel	Can `sealed` modifier be removed from `DisplayAttribute`?	I'm redirected here from MVC6 repo (https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/2706). In MVC6 we are meant to use `DisplayAttribute` to define human readable texts for model's properties. In earlier versions, MVC was using `DisplayNameAttribute` and it could be inherited, so developers were overriding it and customizing texts, messages, labels on the air (like translating or formatting them etc.).  Now MVC6 uses .NET's `DisplayAttribute` for this use and it's sealed and unfortunately we are restricted here now.  Is it possible to remove the `sealed` modifier from this attribute? So I think the frameworks using this attribute will be more customizable.

2103	area-System.Globalization	How should we handle default data for Globalization tests?	"In .NET Core, a large portion of the implementation of our globalization code is built on-top of OS primitives. which we don't control.  Globalization data changes frequently and updates to the data can break unit tests.  Some examples of changes we've had problems with in the past: 1. Collation data changing across releases and platforms, causing sorting tests to break. 2. Locale data changing (e.g a locale adopts a new currency symbol) causing test breaks. 3. Casing data changes, breaking ToUpper/ToLower tests. 4. Different platforms supporting different version of IDNA.  In our internal tests, we've taken a few approaches to solving these problems: 1. Implementing another set of (hopefully lightweight) P/Invokes on-top of OS Functions and using them to generate the expected data at runtime. 2. Disabling specific tests (by hand) on specific platforms or changing the expected data for a specific platform via a runtime test. 3. Encoding metadata about the version of Unicode a platform supports and the version a test requires and skipping tests if they don't match.  As I start to open source more of our collation tests, I'm running into problems where we depend on support libraries that implement the OS behavior from (1).  It's not clear to me that adopting this is the right long term approach.  There's a bunch of platform specific code in these support libraries which will also have to be brought cross platform.  The library also contains a fair amount of logic itself.  My general preference would be to do something like the following: 1. Use XUnit data driven tests (i.e. `[Theory]`) to write tests that decouple the implementation of the test from the input data. 2. Using `[MemberData]` control the set of inputs that flow to each test based on runtime platform detection.  For example, consider something like the following:  ``` csharp     [Theory]     [MemberData(""CompareToData"")]     public static void CompareTo(string localeName, string left, string right, int expected, CompareOptions options)     {         CompareInfo ci = CompareInfo.GetCompareInfo(localeName);          int result = ci.Compare(left, right, options);          Assert.Equal(expected, Math.Sign(result));     }      public static IEnumerable<object[]> CompareToData     {         get         {             yield return new object[] { """", ""Works Everywhere"", ""WORKS EVERYWHERE"", 0, CompareOptions.IgnoreCase };              if (PlatformDetection.IsWindows)             {                 yield return /* ... some set of data that only works on Windows ... */;             }         }     } ```  Will will also need the ability to run certain cases on a specific version of Windows (since behavior changes between versions) or a specific version of ICU.  However, I would expect the general shape of the tests would remain the same (`[Theory]`'s + `[MemberData]`'s) and the only thing that would differ would be the filtering we use when deciding if we include a test case in the MemberData.  I think there are two downsides with this approach: 1. Bringing a new version of an existing platform online is more expensive.  Since we no longer call to the OS to get our oracle data, we will need to investigate test failures to understand if there are product bugs or simply changes in OS algorithms. 2. `[Theory]` is slower than simply having a ton of a `Assert`'s for different cases (or doing a loop) in one `[Fact]`.  The major slowdown was in test discovery.  As an experiment (and to ease some debugging for some work I was doing), I ported the [NormalizationAll](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Globalization.Extensions/tests/Normalization/NormalizationAll.cs) test to use `[Theory]` and the test which used complete very quickly now take about a minute to run (There are 72K test cases, XUnit reports that it took 10.6 seconds to execute the tests (compared to 1.5 when using a loop), but that didn't count the ~50 seconds to discover the tests).  It also appears that much of this time is spent even if the tests would not be run (e.g due to `[ActiveIssue]` or `[OuterLoop]`).  Ideally this could be fixed, but I am not sure, naively it feels weird that you pay an order of magnitude penalty in test execution because of Theory, but I have not dug into the internals of xUnit.  The mitigation here is to not use [Theory] when doing so would generate tons of cases, I guess, and just do a loop ourselves (ideally still over something like a member data API).  I'm not sure if these are dealbreakers or not.  (2) seems bad, but is a general problem for us adopting Theory for large data-sets, which seems to be a a problem for more than just globalization.  I also really hope that we can adopt something like this, since it makes reporting for data driven tests so much nicer.  I'm interested in what @stephentoub and @tarekgh think here.  Does the pain of OS Data updates make the OS Wrapper library the right approach, even if it brings in a lot of extra code and causes a another large amount of work when we bring up a new platform?  Is the fixed data + filtering approach a better long term direction?  Do we need both for some reason? "
2106	area-System.Security	Proposal: Add Ed25519 and Curve25519 Algorithms to System.Security.Cryptography	The System.Security.Cryptography namespace contains several commonly used cryptographic algorithms. I propose the addition of two commonly used algorithms which are currently missing: - **Ed25519** is an implementation of an _Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm_. - **Curve25519** is an algorithm designed to be used with _elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange algorithm_.  Both are based on the same elliptic curve. Many open source projects (e.g. OpenSSH, OpenBSD) seem to prefer this elliptic curve for use in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). It is therefore beneficial to have these algorithms implemented in CoreFX.  The two algorithms should be included in the existing classes in the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace, but it must be possible to explicitly ask for the usage of these algorithms.

The algorithm seems to make no use of [GetHashCode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms132155.aspx). Why does it not instead take a `Func<TSource, TSource, bool>` predicate, similar to how [First](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb535050.aspx) takes a `Func<TSource, bool>`? 
2119	area-System.Runtime	Make all structs that claim to be thread-safe dereference `this` at most once per entrypoint	`ImmutableArray<T>` goes to great lengths to be thread-safe by [never dereferencing `this` more than once per public entrypoint](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/1dc118cc46f88e4889a23190b450d89e565967fd/src/System.Collections.Immutable/src/System/Collections/Immutable/ImmutableArray%601.cs#L18-L33) (to fix bug #191). Other structs in the Framework do _not_ take this care (such as `DateTime`, `Nullable<T>`, or `System.Int32`), despite [claiming to be thread-safe in MSDN documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.DateTime%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).  Should we take the same care for the other structs?   The community [has been fascinated](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30957211/what-advantage-is-there-to-storing-this-in-a-local-variable-in-a-struct-method/30957262) by the pattern in `ImmutableArray<T>` and brought up that it might make sense to spread it around more.

It is currently inconvenient to create these pairs as one needs to specify type arguments to the constructor. A simple factory method would make it more succinct since the C# and VB compilers can usually infer the generic arguments:  ``` C#     public static class KeyValuePair     {         public static KeyValuePair<K, V> Create<K, V>(K key, V value)         {             return new KeyValuePair<K, V>(key, value);         }     } ```  this pattern is already used by ImmutableArray.

2146	area-System.Linq	Add commonly required Enumerable methods (DistinctBy, ExceptBy, AsChunked, ...)	We have Distinct, Except, Intersect, Union, etc. Often it is required, though, to base the set operation on some key. OrderBy can do that for example.  I request that the following methods be added: - DistinctBy (pick the first element deterministically for each key) - ExceptBy (return all items of the first sequence that do not have a matching key in the second) - IntersectBy (return the first item in a.Concat(b) for each unique key where the key appears in both collections) - UnionBy (return the first item in a.Concat(b) for each unique key) - MaxBy/MinBy  The set operations need to deal with duplicate keys in a sensible way. I have added to that list my idea for how to do that in sane and well-defined way.  <hr>  Another commonly required helper method is one that splits a sequence into chunks of a fixed size:  ``` static IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> AsChunked<T>(this IEnumerable<T> sequence, int chunkSize) ```  This is useful for many things, for example: - Split a list into pages - Make AsParallel operate on coarser items by feeding it chunks - If you want to save a huge stream of items to files you can use this to split the sequence into one chunk per file - Request rows from the database in chunks of 1000 IDs  This requirement comes up on Stack Overflow a lot and there is no built-in way to do it.  The chunks should be drawn lazily. In fact the items of each chunk should be lazy as well. This allows for very big chunks such as 1 billion items per chunk.  Maybe we need two variants: 1. `IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> AsChunkedLazy` 2. `IEnumerable<T[]> AsChunkedEager`  The second one would be easier to handle for consumers. The first one requires more disciplined use because each chunk must be enumerated at most once and the chunks must be enumerated in order. This is required for an efficient streaming operation.

I believe because of this we also don't get coverage on any of the RyuJIT specific optimizations around Vectors as part of our unit tests.  I think it would be ideal if we also ran tests on a 64 bit runtime and it corresponded to some LKG build from [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr).  /cc @stephentoub

2152	area-System.Xml	[Perf] Fix XmlDocument/XPath to properly compare strings by ref	"XmlDocument/XPath when comparing namespaces it uses fixed string object (from private class defined in XmlConst.cs). During the split of System.Xml.dll to smaller libraries (XmlDocument, ReaderWriter, XPath, XPath.XmlDocument) we introduced shared XmlConst.cs file for those constants and thus different references for those strings. To optimize implementation is comparing built-in namespaces by reference and thus in some cases it doesn't work properly and causes some undefined behavior. The cases which were breaking tests were already fixed although there are some other broken scenarios which got introduced when running product on Desktop (runtime). Steps: - [x] Workaround to not compare by ref (one line change in Ref.cs) to unblock Desktop ASAP (we are gonna lose some perf but correctness is more important than perf) - https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/2154 - [ ] Make sure there is only one copy of string constants in one of the libraries (ReaderWriter or XmlDocument) and other libraries should get the valid and needed references to string some other way (i.e. through XmlDoc's NameTable or exposing something new in the contract if NameTable is too slow or not possible) - [ ] Re-enable comparison by ref and validate it is passing when running on Desktop runtime (on Win 10) and coreclr  **Except for the first checkbox it is up for grabs**  Please revert Ref.cs to its original form with the last checkbox:  ``` csharp         public static bool Equal(string strA, string strB)         { #if DEBUG             if (((object)strA != (object)strB) && string.Equals(strA, strB))                 System.Diagnostics.Debug.Fail(""Ref.Equal: Object comparison used for non-atomized string '"" + strA + ""'""); #endif             return (object)strA == (object)strB;         } ``` "

2169	area-Serialization	Fix serialization for type which has DataMember with special Name values	This issue happens only for DCJS and affecting both NetCore and NetNative, due to missing method from recent merging of DCJS.  cc: @SGuyGe @shmao @zhenlan  
2171	area-Infrastructure	When compiling in TFS, using the ECMA key requires setting <AssemblyKeyType> before dir.props import	Because the TFS build targets sets <SkipSigning>true, sign.targets won't respect the UseECMAKey property.  Additionally, because dir.props sets <AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile> based on the AssemblyKeyType conditional, AssemblyKeyType needs to be set in the project before importing dir.props.

2177	area-Serialization	Silent Failure: XmlSerializer.Deserialize Method (XmlReader)	"I attempted to file this on Connect, but it appears that even though Connect states that it is still accepting issues, it is closed.  There is a bug in the current release version (4.5.2) that fails w/o any errors, on the deserialization of a property of a class that is defined as a List<string>.  I haven't tried lists of other types, but they are probably affected as well, and this only affects Deserialize, not Serialize.  There are 2 classes below, and both serialize properly, in the exact same way.  However, the Works class will deserialize properly, while the DoesNotWork class will not.  The DoesNotWork class will end up with an Items property that contains a list with zero items, when 1 or more items exist.  We discovered this in a property that has code in both the get and set accessors, while all properties that don't have any get or set code work perfectly.  ``` C# [Serialize] [XmlRoot(""root"")] public class Works {     [XmlElement(""items"")]        public List<string> Items { get; set; } }   [Serialize] [XmlRoot(""root"")] public class DoesNotWork {     private List<string> _items;      [XmlElement(""items"")]        public List<string> Items     {         get { return _items; }         set { _items = value; }     } } ``` "
2189	area-System.Xml	Bring XSL-T to CoreFX	The [xUnit.net](https://github.com/xunit) unit test framework uses XSL-T to transform its native XML reporting format into other XML (NUnit, xUnit.net v1) formats as well as to generate HTML reports. This strategy works well for desktop runners, but is currently not supported in our [DNX runner](https://github.com/xunit/dnx.xunit) because of the lack of XSL-T support on the platform. This is a [feature request for our DNX runner](https://github.com/xunit/dnx.xunit/issues/42) which we cannot satisfy without some form of XSL-T support.  In particular, the code we use today exercises `XslCompiledTransform`: https://github.com/xunit/xunit/tree/05826dcfd3cee97d93ff63201db0296933dd3511/src/xunit.runner.reporters.desktop

2203	area-System.Security	Add support for X509 revocation checks on Unix	Due to a lack of a stable networking stack, the X509Chain for Unix does not support CRL downloading or OCSP.  There are a couple of different parts to be done: - OCSP (Online checks) - CRL fetching (Online checks) - CRL caching (Online/Offline checks)   - CRL cache refresh - Using the CRL during chain building 
2204	area-System.Security	Figure out a strategy for X509VerificationFlags on Unix	Because OpenSSL reports back only the first error it finds, the Ignore\* flags can't be used to disregard error codes coming back.  Whatever flags cannot be supported should be changed to a PlatformNotSupportedException. 
2207	area-System.Security	Add support for additional LocalMachine X509Stores on Unix, or throw PlatformNotSupportedException	LM\Root, and to a lesser degree LM\CA, are populated from a system directory.  The other stores could be put into another path area, if we wanted to support having writable system stores.  If writable system stores makes no sense, then other LM* stores should throw a descriptive PlatformNotSupportedException, not a blank NotImplementedException. 
2209	area-System.Numerics	Support for SSE4 intrinsics by RyuJIT 	Support for many of the interesting instructions like popcnt (technically SSE4a) could be an interesting addition and prove to be useful to avoid using unmanaged code in certain performance sensitive applications.   Many (technically all) of the operations can be emulated in CPU when not available with specific optimizations for the target platform or even have the ability with specially crafted if-then-else optimizations. That would allow to even switch to an entirely different algorithm without any runtime impact (if properly done at the jitting phase). 
2210	area-System.Security	Consider multi-threading implications on the OpenSSL ERR_get_error queue.	OpenSSL compiled with OPENSSL_FIPS seems to have a single static ERR_STATE object for the process.  The default appears to be set up for providing the capabilities for stack-per-thread, but OPENSSL_thread_id() appears to return the process ID, not the thread ID.  The mainline seems to be served by `OPENSSL_set_id_callback` to something returning a thread ID; and lightup for FIPS could try invoking `int_ERR_lib_init`, which resets the library to the non-FIPS way of error management (though that theoretically has FIPS implications...). 
2217	area-System.Text	UTF8Encoding should support encoding/decoding of unpaired surrogates	"According to RFC 3629 encoding/decoding unmatched surrogates should be disallowed:  ""The definition of UTF-8 prohibits encoding character numbers between U+D800 and U+DFFF, which are reserved for use with the UTF-16 encoding form (as surrogate pairs) and do not directly represent    characters.""  However, this hasn't been followed by real world encoders/decoders. For example, the ECMA-335 standard encodes string arguments of custom attributes using UTF8 and the compilers allowed unpaired surrogates in the attribute argument. Another example is PDB - the file paths in PDB are stored as UTF8 encoded strings and unpaired surrogates are also allowed. The same for values of local string constants (e.g. `const string surrogate = ""\ud800""`).  To avoid breaking changes Roslyn needs to allow unpaired surrogates in the above cases and the MetadataReader should also use a variant of UTF8 encoding that is able to decode them. Currently Roslyn has a custom implementation of UTF8 encoder originating from CCI. In general, it seems that pragmatically a UTF16-UTF8 round-tripping is desirable in certain scenarios and UTF8Encoding should support it.  I propose to add a constructor to UTF8 Encoding that takes a bool allowUnpairedSurrogates (false by default) that can be used by both Roslyn and MetadataReader. "

2241	area-System.Linq	Enumerable.ToArray() fails on the results of some uses of Enumerable.Cast()	Generally any implementation of `IEnumerable<T>` should be able to produce a `T[]` with a call to `ToArray()`.  However, in some cases the `IEnumerable<T>` produced by a call to `Cast()` will in fact be an array of another type that can be converted on the fly by the implementation of `GetEnumerator()`. This works well in many cases and is a valuable optimisation (rather than going through `CastIterator`) but if `ToArray()` is called on it, the result is an `ArrayTypeMismatchException` that would not be expected by the user, especially since code might call `ToArray()` without knowing that `Cast()` had been used, or pass the result of `Cast()` to a method, not knowing that `ToArray()` would be used.  In particular this happens if you `Cast()` an array of one `enum` type to another `enum` type.

2252	area-System.Collections	Provide a sorting algorithm with good behavior on nearly-sorted inputs.	The existing 4.5 Array.sort is implemented with intro sort.  While this has reasonable behavior, it effectively has the same number of comparisons regardless of input size.  This number of comparisons is (as expected) around `n * log_n`.  While this is acceptable for random inputs, it is unfortunately much slower for nearly-sorted inputs.  More recent algorithms (like TimSort) can provide massive improvements here, sorting nearly-sorted lists with a nearly linear number of comparisons.  For code-paths where sorting is expensive, and where comparisons are not cheap, a better sort algorithm built into the Fx would be appreciated.    Whether or not this becomes the default is up to you.  But providing it as an option would still be a huge boon.  Note: this hits Roslyn+TypeScript.  We often produce trees (i.e. for tagging) from nearly sorted data.  There may be hundreds of thousands of elements in this data.  Being able to sort in near-linear time means we can then build our trees in linear time.  With data sets this large, the difference between `n` and `n log n` is actually quite significant.   
2254	area-System.Runtime	Provide ways to parse sections of a string, not an entire string.	Right now .Net provides lots of ways to convert strings to other values.  For example `Int32.TryParse`.  This is fine if you are starting with a string, but it's very suboptimal if you have a larger string, and are trying to parse out a piece of it.  You are forced to first create a substring, and then parse that.  This adds GC pressure to the system and can be a large perf impact.  It would be very beneficial to have overloads of these functions that took a start+length.  Alternatively, if there were some sort of struct representing a piece of a string, that could also work as well.    Right now this impacts TypeScript greatly.  We have to marshal data from JavaScript to .Net.  This comes in as a string to us, which we then need to parse out into actual values (like ints).  We are forced to either send tons of strings over (not ideal), or send one big string over that we then are forced to break into tons of small strings.  Right now we've worked around this by hand-writing our own Int32.Parse that can work on subsections of a string.  But this is non-ideal and would really be served inside the runtime so everyone could benefit.  This is a place where really ony the runtime could implement this thing.  There is so much complexity around string parsing (even just for ints), with things like FormatSpecifiers and whatnot, that trying to duplicate it in another library would be unfeasible.

2278	area-System.Collections	Rename Validation to Microsoft.Internal.Validation	"The C# (and possibly VB compiler) will match the top-level namespace `Validation` in `System.Collections.Immutable` even though it only contains internal types. This prevents customers from using a type named `Validation` in their code. Specifically, assume a customer has defined the type like this:  ``` C# namespace Support {     public static class Validation     {         public static bool IsValid(string x) { return true; }     } } ```  Consuming this type stops working when `System.Collections.Immutable` is referenced:  ``` C# using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;  using Support;  namespace ImmutableTest {     public class Experiment     {         // With out Immutable included, the below works just fine.         // Once I include immutable, Validation, which was really         // Support.Validation, but was found because of the using         // statement above, it starts to fail showing that it can't         // find IsValid in the namespace Validation.     public void Test1() { Validation.IsValid(""AS""); }     public void Test2() { Support.Validation.IsValid(""AS""); }     } } ```  According to @jaredpar this behavior is by-design:  > This behavior is by design for C# at least.  A simple name lookup will prefer matching namespaces over types (section 7.5.2).   I didnt check the VB spec but it almost assuredly has the same design here.    In order to avoid that conflict, we should rename the `Validation` namespace to something like `System.Validation`. "

The missing standard implementations in BCL are required by many consumer scenarios, for which .NET applications rely on [third party libraries](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1533114/863980). One of the chief scenario is Content Query Web Part (CQWP) in SharePoint, where the users' XSLT code can be drastically minimized if v2 is supported by `System.Xml.XPath`. As for most parts, there are backward compatibility fallbacks available, that is; the code written in XSLT 2 precisely, can be expressed verbosely in XSLT 1 and since so forth.  ### Pitfalls    Unfortunately, (besides the existing third-party libraries' APIs) I do not have an off-hand -- concrete -- method list to propose, as it requires further brain-storming on whether to auto-select processor based on the input or to explicitly separate the namespaces (`System.Xml.XPath2` and `System.Xml.XPath3`).     The point to ponder being; since the sub-languages XPath 2 and XPath 3 intrinsically facilitates backward compatibility modes, see [XPath 2: J.1.3 Backwards Compatibility Behavior](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#backwards-compatibility-behavior) and [XPath 3: 3.10 Backwards Compatible Processing](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#backwards), should the API be any different than the existing one and let consumers select the standard mode?  
2315	area-System.Drawing	Primitive Color Type for .NET Core	## Primitive Color Type for .NET Core  The previous discussion of primitives showed that color discussion should expand into a separate issue.   The primitive discussion was started because many customers wanted to move to the .NET Core, but were blocked by the lack of System.Drawing primitives there. There was much discussion and internal debate over defining Point, Rect, and Size and much of that was fueled by scenarios that you guys cited in the previous primitives issue. (Thank you!) Here we are looking for additional scenarios to discuss the advantages of creating a new Color type for the cross-platform .NET Core Graphics API. Feel free to repost your two cents from the previous primitives issue. Thanks for your input!  Topics of Interest: (This is where providing scenarios would be awesome) 1.  Naming (ColorRgba, sRGB) 2.  Different Color Formats (int8 bits, float 16 bits, float 32 bits, alpha or not) Color4F, Color3F, Color4F 3.  Color Spaces (conversion issues) 4.  Gamma vs Linear 5.  Extension Methods (vector operations: lerp, scaling, conversions: from RGB to HSB and reverse, from vectors) 6.  Semantic parity with CSS 7.  WinRT Compatibility  Limit Scope: KnownColors will not be brought over as they dont always translate well into the cross-platform world depending on the hardware so lets focus our discussion on defining the Color object for now. 
2316	area-System.Linq	LINQ/PLINQ `Sum(int)` does not loft to long for intermediate calculation.	Currently, even if the total value of elements in a collection falls within the range of the type, LINQ/PLINQ will throw errors if the _running_ total would overflow.  That is:  ``` new[] { int.MaxValue, int.MaxValue, int.MinValue }.Sum() ```  ... currently throws an overflow exception because of the first two items, even though the total is within range (`int.MaxValue - 1`).  It may be beneficial to loft to long for the intermediate cancellation, similar to how float lofts to double (although that particular one is more about an accurate result, not exactly overflow). 
2317	area-System.Linq	Make IOrderedEnumerable<T> covariant	Today, I was trying to convert an `IOrderedEnumerable<string>` to an `IOrderedEnumerable<object>`, but the compiler responded with an error. Looking into the interface, there doesn't seem to be any reason why it can't be [covariant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd799517%28v=vs.110%29.aspx), and in fact when I copied and pasted the interface and changed the class signature to `IOrderedEnumerable<out T>` everything compiled fine.    Can we change this in the BCL, as well? There doesn't seem to be a reason not to.

2320	area-System.Reflection	(api review) IL Object Model	"@terrajobst  From the recent [API Review 2015-07-08](https://github.com/dotnet/apireviews/tree/master/2015-07-08-ildasm-and-drawing) **IL Object Model**  **Observations** - Implement a custom object model. - use [Mono's Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) implementation.  **Parsing** - From the byte stream - From the text representation.  **Output** - Byte stream - Text Representation   The issue here I see is that some instructions have ""pointers"" to data embedded into the assembly bytes. A very common one is `Strings`. So you're going to need an object to represent that so that construction of the output bytes is correct.  **IL Labels** These point to data objects that encoded into the assembly.  - Strings being a common one. - `switch` uses them as jump targets.  A benefit of an IL object model, is that you could get an IL representation of a method, without doing a full compilation.   **Targeting**  For example   Roslyn should ""compile"" to an IL Object model, first. which then permit for further diagnostic analysers (or an optional layer). On the produced IL For example:- A analyser to help minimise Boxing operations. you'll should be able to trickle that information back to source-code level.  **Compilation** The last stage would ""Compilation Targets"" for various architectures eg. x86, x64,ARM and maybe even Typescript. This could be supplied as NuGet package.    ---  Side Note I implemented a partial implementation of an object model for IL [here](https://github.com/AdamSpeight2008/IL.Sarc) "

2323	area-System.Linq	Add Enumerable.ToHashSet	We have `Enumerable.To*` methods for many common collections. `HashSet` is sorely missing.

2324	area-System.Runtime	Add common helper methods to the String class	"The `String` class is missing some helper methods for string manipulation that are commonly needed. Of course it is possible for developers to add extension methods but that should not be required. here, I'll propose a list of methods that I think can be easily understood and are commonly required. The ordering of this list starts with the least controversial in my mind. 1. `bool Contains(this string str, string value, StringComparison comparisonType)`. We have no Contains version that takes a StringComparison. The workaround with `IndexOf` is awkward and feels like magic. 2. `Replace(..., StringComparison)`. Right now, `Replace` always uses `Ordinal`. 3. `string Left(this string str, int count)` as well as `Right`. `Left` is equivalent to `str.Substring(0, count)` but right is `str.Substring(str.Length - count, count)`. 4. `Truncate(int maxLength)`. This is not equivalent to Substring(maxLength) because Substring throws if the string is short. 5. `bool IsValidIndex(this string str, int index)` tests whether the argument can be used to obtain a character from the indexer. That sometimes comes in handy. Also `bool IsValidRange(this string str, int index, int count)`. Both can be useful for `Debug.Assert` assertions. 6. `string TrimPrefix(this string str, string prefix)` as well as `TrimPostfix`. It turns out that when working with externally generated strings (ETL processes) it is very common to need to remove a prefix. For example to get a JIRA issue number as an int you do `int.Parse(""PROJ-2317"".TrimPrefix(""PROJ-""))`. `Replace(..., ""PROJ-"", """")` is not equivalent and semantically wrong. The `TrimStart` method cannot be used here. Further helper methods would be `EnsurePrefix/Postfix`. 7. Some helpers to work on strings that might be null or empty. This comes up _all the time_.  ```         public static string EmptyToNull(this string str)         {             return string.IsNullOrEmpty(str) ? null : str;         }         public static string NullToEmpty(this string str)         {             return str ?? string.Empty;         }         public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(this string str)         {             return string.IsNullOrEmpty(str);         }         public static bool IsNullOrWhitespace(this string str)         {             return string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(str);         } ``` 1. `SplitLines()`. Returns the string split into lines. Need to define how to deal with OS-specific line endings. Probably, this should just be `str.Replace(""\r"", """").Split('\n')` which seems to work for everything.  I can see some issues with some of these proposals. They are not perfect but I want to get the discussion going. I feel the BCL has a blind spot here. The list certainly starts out with a few no-brainers. "
2327	area-System.Linq	Make Enumerable.Any use the same optimizations that Count has (ICollection checks)	`Enumerable.Count` uses `ICollection` and `ICollection<T>` to perform a fast and allocation-free computation. `Enumerable.Any` should do that as well.  The fact that `Any` does not check `ICollection` is pretty much the only downside to using `Any` vs. `Count() != 0`. This downside should be eliminated.

2329	area-System.Threading	Use a more dependable policy for thread pool thread injection	As of .NET 4.5 the thread pool injects one thread per 0.5sec if it thinks more threads are required. This is a problem if the number of required threads suddenly increases. Example: A corporate ASP.NET website is idle at night. In the morning at 8AM 1000 people log on and start working. If the app is using let's say 100 threads starting from 8AM it will take like 50sec to create all of them. Until then there will be serious delays and timeouts. It is possible to construe arbitrarily bad scenarios.  **Problem statement:** If thread pool load suddenly increases in IO bound workloads the pool is too slow to respond. This causes throughput and availability disruption. IO bound workloads relying on synchronous IO are common. Sudden workload changes are also common. Sometimes the workload can change due to a problem outside of the developer's control: A web service timing out or a database become slow.  Let me stress that this causes service interruption.  You can easily repro this yourself. Run a load test on an ASP.NET site with `Thread.Sleep(10000);`. The thread count goes up by 2 each second.  Starting and shutting down a thread was benchmarked by me to be around 1ms in total. Threads are not really an expensive resource. The thread pool should be a lot more eager to create and destroy threads. 500ms delay to potentially save 1ms is not a good trade-off.  **Easy fix:** I propose lowering the injection delay to 100ms. This reduces the problem given above by 5x. Ideally, the rate would be configurable. The shutdown delay could be lowered from 30s as well. Keeping an idle thread for 30000ms to save 1ms seems excessive. In this ticket I'm not that concerned with retiring threads, though.  **Smarter, riskier fix:** The delay could depend on the number of threads in existence, the core count and the perceived pressure on the thread-pool. The injection rate could be: - 0ms delay for up to (ProcessorCount \* 1) threads - 50ms delay for up to (ProcessorCount \* 4) threads - Starting from that a delay of (100ms \* (ThreadCount / ProcessorCount \* someFloatFactor)). Reasoning: The more the CPU is oversubscribed the slower we want to inject. Maybe we need to have a maximum delay of 1sec. Or, the delay must rise sub-linearly (e.g. sqrt).  Note, that the Windows Kernel has some thread pool injection heuristics that apply back pressure the more threads are in existence. This seems to work.

2332	area-System.Net	Improve ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit	"`ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit` appears to be `2` on .NET 4.5 in non-ASP.NET apps. This is too low for almost any production load. I don't know what this low limit is supposed to accomplish. I understand the presence of _some_ limit as a safety measure but `2` is really never useful.  Many developers have trouble with that: https://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=#complete=1&hl=en&q=site:stackoverflow.com+%22ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit%22 When somebody asks ""My HTTP requests are unexpectedly slow"" the default answer is ""DefaultConnectionLimit = int.MaxValue"" and this solves the problem in about 80% of the cases. This is strong evidence that the default should be changed. This is an ongoing cause for trouble and surprise.  There are three choices that I can think of: 1. Unlimited. ASP.NET has chosen this (`SetAutoConfigLimits`) presumably for good reasons. I think this is the least surprising choice. When a developer says `new WebClient().Download(...)` he expects the request to be sent right away. The dev is responsible for ensuring a sane degree of concurrency. he can use `SemaphoreSlim` or the service point infrastructure for that. 2. A constant factor on the CPU count of the machine (e.g. 10). Pro: This scales up with the size of the machine. Con: It might be a low-CPU (e.g. 2) machine that does little processing but relays it's request to some backend REST service that does the heavy lifting. 100 outstanding requests per CPU would not surprise me at all in such a situation. The benefits of async IO would be throttled. 3. `1`. At least this would make developers very quickly aware that the limit exists and that they need to change it. Maybe the value of `2` follows from that reasoning. I consider this to be a weak choice that is going to be perceived as stupid (as is `2`).  Another reason for ""Unlimited"" is that there should not be global limits but per-service limits. A .NET process often hosts many components each of which potentially take from the global limit. They could interact in surprising (and spooky) ways.  I think the .NET Framework should pick the default value that has the least surprise and set this to `int.MaxValue`.  Also, consider revising the default value of `Expect100Continue`. I believe there is not a single developer in the world who expects each `POST` request to be performed twice by default. I do not know a single case where this was ever deemed useful. Disabling this behavior would entail, I believe, low compatibility risk. (See http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Expect100Continue) "
2335	area-System.Collections	Improve ConcurrentBag<T> GetEnumerator performance	Currently `ConcurrentBag<T>` `GetEnumerator()` causes list copying everytime enumerator is accessed eg. through `foreach`. This causes strain on the GC and list copying is also heavy operation on large bags.  There should be alternative methods to enumarate the bag contents or implement `GetEnumerator()` so that it does not cause list copying. I have presented here 3 possbile solutions to this problem.  **Solution 1)** Add `ForEach` method to `ConcurrentBag<T>`:  ``` CSharp public void ForEach(Func<T, bool> action) {     // Short path if the bag is empty     if (_headList == null)         return;      bool lockTaken = false;     try     {         FreezeBag(ref lockTaken);          ThreadLocalList currentList = _headList;         while (currentList != null) // Go through thread lists         {             Node currentNode = currentList._head;             while (currentNode != null) // Go through thead specific linked list             {                 if (!action(currentNode._value))                     return; // User wanted to break the operation                 currentNode = currentNode._next;             }             currentList = currentList._nextList;         }     }     finally     {         UnfreezeBag(lockTaken);     } } ```  `ForEach` function takes user specified `Func<T,bool>` delegate. This delegate takes the bag item as an argument and returns true/false depending on whether the user wants to continue or stop the enumeration operation.  Here `ForEach` operation would lock the bag so that other threads would need to wait for the operation to finish. Therefore results of this operation would represent the bag as a moment-in-time snapshot.  **Solution 2)**  Add `GetEnumerableSlim` function:  ``` CSharp public IEnumerable<T> GetEnumerableSlim() {     ThreadLocalList currentList = _headList;     while (currentList != null)     {         Node currentNode = currentList._head;         while (currentNode != null)         {             yield return currentNode._value;             currentNode = currentNode._next;         }         currentList = currentList._nextList;     } } ```  This would require an additional change to the internal class `Node`:  ``` CSharp internal class Node {     public Node(T value)     {         _value = value;     }     public readonly T _value;     public volatile Node _next; // This needs to be marked as volatile     public Node _prev; } ```  `GetEnumerableSlim` would enumerate the bag contents concurrently without locking the bag. The proposed implementation is thread safe from memory model point of view. The fields `ConcurrentBag<T>._headList`, `ThreadLocalList._head` and `Node._next` are all volatile variables. Therefore all the threads always have the newest value available. In addition the `Node._value` reference/value is immutable. `GetEnumerableSlim` is safe to use concurrently.  Of course here the enumerator would miss some of the concurrent additions/removals from the bag. Also enumerator could contain modification after the `GetEnumerator` was called. Similiar behaviour is also used in `ConcurrentDictionary<K,T>`, `GetEnumerator` which may also miss some of the concurrent changes or contain new changes after the `GetEnumerator` was called. Therefore the `GetEnumerableSlim` is consistent with other concurrent collections and their enumerator implementations. (It would be intresting to know why `ConcurrentBag<T>` `GetEnumerator` was originally implementeted so that it copies the bag contents to a list where as the other concurrent collections enumerate the contents concurrently eg. `ConcurrentQueue<T>`.)  **Solution 3)** Replace `GetEnumerator` with `GetEnumeratorSlim` implementation. This solution would totally eliminate the risk of performance degradation due to list allocations. But this might not be possible if the existing code relies on the fact that `GetEnumerator` returns moment-in-time representation of the bag.

2338	area-System.Collections	Add ConcurrentBag<T> and ConcurrentQueue<T> Clear method	Currently `ConcurrentBag<T>` does not support clearing of the bag. Currently only way to clear the bag is to call `TryTake` in a loop which is suboptimal in high concurrency applications:  ``` CSharp T dummy; while(bag.TryTake(out dummy)) {} ```  Instead `Clear` method could be implemented so that the bag is emptied at once. Here is the proposed implementation:  ``` CSharp public void Clear() {     // Short path if the bag is empty     if (_headList == null)         return;      bool lockTaken = false;     try     {         FreezeBag(ref lockTaken);          ThreadLocalList currentList = _headList;         while (currentList != null)         {             currentList.Reset();             currentList = currentList._nextList;         }     }     finally     {         UnfreezeBag(lockTaken);     } } ```  Internal class `ThreadLocalList` needs new `Reset/Invalidate` method which sets the thread specific linked list _head and _tail to null as well as resets the counters. GC would then collect the non referenced linked list nodes.  ``` CSharp internal void Reset() {     _head = null;     _tail = null;     _count = 0;     _stealCount = 0; } ```  `Clear` would lock the bag for the duration of the operation since it could cause undefined behaviour  if other threads would access the bag while linked lists are being reseted. (Similarly ConcurrentDictionary<K,T> also locks the dictionary when `Clear` is called.)

2352	area-System.Runtime	API Addition: Add generic Array.Reverse<T>	Add generic `Array.Reverse<T>`. ## Rationale  [`Array.Reverse`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/ef1e2ab328087c61a6878c1e84f4fc5d710aebce/src/mscorlib/src/System/Array.cs#L1570-L1606) is non-generic. It includes a fast path for a known set of primitive types via a call into the runtime (see [`TrySZReverse`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/4cf8a6b082d9bb1789facd996d8265d3908757b2/src/classlibnative/bcltype/arrayhelpers.cpp#L390-L424)), otherwise it falls back to slower code paths that involve boxing for value types. This is a significant performance cost for non-primitive value types, ~22x slower.  Callers of `Array.Reverse` (like `List<T>.Reverse` and `ImmutableArray<T>.Builder.Reverse`) are affected by this performance issue. As a workaround, [`List<T>.Reverse`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/1231) and [`ImmutableArray<T>.Builder.Reverse`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/2354) are being updated to not use the non-generic `Array.Reverse` method until the generic `Array.Reverse<T>` method becomes available.  Other non-generic methods on `Array` have generic counterparts like `Array.Sort` and `Array.Sort<T>`, so this would just be making `Reverse` consistent with those. ## Proposed API  ``` c# public abstract class Array : ... {     // Proposed     public static void Reverse<T>(T[] array);     public static void Reverse<T>(T[] array, int index, int length);      // Existing     public static void Reverse(Array array);     public static void Reverse(Array array, int index, int length); } ```

2400	area-System.Linq	Take advantage of algorihmic differences between first-from-ordered and ordered.	The fact of something being ordered can have implications for subsequent operations.  The ordering Linq methods (`OrderBy`, `ThenBy`, etc.) operate first in O(1) time and space to make a promise of a subsequent O(n log n) sort in O(n) space. In many case though the following operation does not need all of the promised operation.  `.OrderBy(?).First()`, `.OrderBy(?).First(?)`, and so on request that a sequence be sorted (O(n log n) time/O(n) space) and then the first element taken (O(1) time and space) which is in total an O(n log n) time/O(n) space operation. However, it is reducible to the O(n) time/O(1) space operation of identifying just the item in question which can be done in O(n) time and O(1) space.  As `First`, `Last` and their variants are particularly common with ordered sequences (in some cases not having any meaning without an order), I think this would be a worth-while optimisation.  There are other optimisations available, such as all aggregate operations (`Sum` etc.) could be moved from O(n log n) time to O(n) time simply by extracting the source and ignoring the ordering, this may not be as common a case as to make it worthwhile. One could argue that the user should have not put the ordering in there in the first place, and while the cost of checking for an ordered source is slightly, it's not worth paying it on all aggregate operations to benefit a flawed case.  `Reverse` is somewhere in the middle. It's reasonable to expect someone might construct an ordered sequence and then `Reverse` in some cases. It's got subtleties (one cannot simply reverse all `OrderBy` to `OrderByDescending` and vice-versa because `OrderBy` is documented as performing stable ordering in linq-2-objects and therefore reversed must have reverse source ordering on equivalent items) but wouldn't be hard, but it's less clear whether the pay off would be worth it.  In the more useful cases of `First` etc. there is a fly in the ointment in that this would affect the number of times both key selectors for ordering and predicates for `First` etc. were called. As per #2349 this means side effects on `Func`s would be affected, though perhaps in a way that was less predictable to the user than with that issue anyway.  As such, changing the behaviour of `First` in this case would require either a decision in favour of the change that issue would allow for, or a decision that this case was less harmed by such changing side-effects.  In summary. I propose that `OrderBy().First()` and its cousins be optimised, and the trade-offs of optimising `OrderBy().Reverse()` be considered. 
2402	area-System.IO	DirectoryInfo.CreateSubdirectory(path) trims whitespace and returns parent directory	"Calling directory.CreateSubdirectory(""whitespaces"") will return ""directory"" and create no subdirectory.  ``` DirectoryInfo parentDir = new DirectoryInfo(TestDirectory); DirectoryInfo childDir = parentDir.CreateSubdirectory(""   ""); Assert.Equal(parentDir.FullName + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar, childDir.FullName); ```  If newlines or tabs are used, then it throws as expected:  ``` DirectoryInfo parentDir = new DirectoryInfo(TestDirectory); Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => parentDir.CreateSubdirectory(""\n"")); Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => parentDir.CreateSubdirectory(""\t"")); ```  The reason for this is that dir.CreateSubdirectory(path) essentially wraps around Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.Combine(dir.FullName, path)) which trims trailing whitespace (in this case ""path"").

This is caused by the creation of `XmlDictionaryString` objects which have a `null` `XmlDictionary`.  There's also a bug/change in behavior in `XmlDictionaryString` compared with Desktop. On Desktop, if you specify a `null` value for the dictionary when constructing a new instance, an `ArgumentNullException` will be thrown. In corefx, it will attempt to create an empty instance of `IXmlDictionary` and assign that. It then straight away assigns the passed in `null` value to the dictionary effectively throwing away the empty dictionary that was created.   Some of the Xml writers require the dictionary for an `XmlDicationary` string to be non-null. This is causing a `NullRefException` to be thrown.

2454	area-System.Threading	Remove reentrancy by default from the TPL	The TPL has a few performance features that cause reentrancy. Here are the ones I know of: 1. `TaskCompletionSource.SetXxx` can cause continuations to be executed synchronously. AFAIK this can happen both with or without `ExecuteSynchronously`. Starting with .NET 4.6 there is `RunContinuationsAsynchronously` to disable this behavior. 2. `Task.Wait()` and `Task.Result` can execute an unstarted CPU-based task inline. I do not know of any good workaround from the perspective of the caller of `Wait`/`Result`. Probably, `static Task.Wait(Task)` and related methods have the same problem. 3. `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel()` can execute registered notifications inline. 4. `TaskAwaiter` uses `TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously` if there is no synchronization context set. This forces reentrancy for whatever code completes the task being awaited.  In all of these situations arbitrary code can run as part of invoking the respective TPL method. You might not control that code. There might be no way for you to know what code that is because you are writing a library. In big apps it might be architecturally impossible/unwanted to know what code might run.  This is **arbitrary, non-deterministic reentrancy in multi-threaded code**. This is very dangerous behavior.  Concrete problems (examples): 1. You might call `TaskCompletionSource.SetResult()` under a lock. Now, arbitrary code might run under your lock as well. This can **deadlock**. 2. That arbitrary code might perform blocking operations (e.g. IO). This will now run under your lock and **extend the lock hold time**. 3. The **invariants** of your data might be **temporarily broken**. Due to reentrancy other code can now observe invalid data. 4. **Monitor might fail to provide mutual exclusion** because `lock (x) { lock (x) { } }` does not block/deadlock. Inlining code onto the current thread opens the gates for any locks held by this thread. 5. You might run on a thread with **thread-dependent state** (STA thread, changed priority, deviating culture, `HttpContext.Current` null or not null, ...). This state is now exposed to arbitrary code. It is made available for mutation as well.  **This is very unsafe behavior by default.** The number of questions that come up about it on Stack Overflow is noticeable. The bugs are insidious (racy). Please disable _all_ of these behaviors by default. Make unsafe performance features opt in. I doubt there will be compatibility impact from doing this because all of the behaviors above are, to my knowledge, non-deterministic.  Completion callbacks should always be queued to the thread pool (or to any scheduler if specified) by default. The TPL should be safe by default. Reentrancy behavior should be: 1. Off by default. 2. Opt-in possible. 3. Overriding forced opt out by any side taking part (completing thread and registering thread). A library should be able to force-disable any of this, no matter whether it registers continuations or whether it completes tasks.  This is a problem both for monolithic apps as well as for library authors.

2522	area-System.Security	RSAOpenSsl should support PSS signing	RSAOpenSsl::SignHash throws when the signing mode is other than Pkcs1.    OpenSSL's RSA_sign function only does PKCS1, and that's how signing currently works.  PSS is theoretically available, but needs to be done using lower level API.    Remember to keep it bound to OpenSsl 1.0.1 (if possible... if not, it might have to just throw on OSX).
2523	area-System.Security	RSAOpenSsl should support OAEP padding using a SHA-2 algorithm	Currently it only supports Pkcs1 and OaepSha1.    Other hashing algorithms would work, but it requires doing the OAEP manually, since OpenSSL doesn't expose a convenient wrapper function for this.

2531	area-System.Net	Remove StreamToStreamCopy in HttpClient	This change removes the internal `StreamToStreamCopy` class, which is only used by `StreamContent.SerializeToStreamAsync`, thus avoiding the instance allocation of the class. `Stream` already has a built-in `CopyToAsync` helper that can be used, that `MemoryStream` [overrides](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/ef1e2ab328087c61a6878c1e84f4fc5d710aebce/src/mscorlib/src/System/IO/MemoryStream.cs#L455-L457) to provide a more efficient implementation when the destination is another MemoryStream.  Also some minor cleanup: I made some fields `readonly` that could be, and removed an unused using.  Question about the existing behavior: If an exception is thrown during the copy operation, the source stream won't be disposed (if it can be disposed). Is this is by design? I was going to wrap the `await _content.CopyToAsync(...)` in a try/finally with the dispose in the finally, but I didn't want to change the existing behavior if it is by design.

2537	area-System.IO	Win32FileSystem File.Move is inconsistent with its Exception throws	"There is an inconsistent behavior in File.Move with regards to non existent directories in paths that is present in both the desktop and core frameworks.  If the parent directory of the source file is nonexistent, a FileNotFoundException is thrown. If the parent directory of the dest file is nonexistent, a DirectoryNotFoundException is thrown.  Example:  ``` File.Create(""test1"").Dispose(); File.Move(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), ""test2"", ""test3""), ""test4""); // throws a FileNotFoundException File.Move(""test1"", Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), ""test2"", ""test3"")); // throws a DirectoryNotFoundException ```  The reason for this is that File.Move makes a call to ""InternalExists"" to check that the sourceFile exists in full and if it doesn't then a FileNotFoundException is thrown regardless of which part of the path caused the failure. Removing this check is simple and will leave path checking to the FileSystem implementation (which would be preferable), but it will need to be mirrored in the desktop as well or ignored/worked around on both.

2576	area-System.Threading	System.Threading.Thread should support all runtimes	The current System.Threading.Thread (and System.Threading.ThreadPool) packages only support desktop and CoreCLR.  The problem is that with a name like System.Threading.\* and with threads being a core part of many apps, people won't know (or care!) that UWP apps will lose out on that library because only Task is supported.  The best solution is to implement Thread/ThreadPool for UWP so that people can use the threading model they're most comfortable with and what's most appropriate for the job. Forcing Task for UWP is counterproductive if it'll mean that UWP will lose out on many libraries that choose to use Thread anyway.  When it comes to creation/consumption of .NET Core packages, right now ASPNet is the biggest driver. As much as we want people to use UWP, it's just smaller for now. That puts even greater pressure on UWP as library authors will either not know that Thread isn't available on UWP or care even if they do.  .NET Core is supposed to be unifying the BCL and shielding libraries from platform/runtime differences. Please don't fragment it with something as central as Thread.

2588	area-System.IO	Modified the Unix implementation of FileMove and fixed the corresponding broken FileSystemWatcher tests	- Resolves #2460  - Changed the way the UnixFileSystem does File moving; it was previously implemented using the rename syscall but now uses a combination of link and unlink. The side effect of this change is that the FileSystemWatcher will now treat File.Move as a deletion. - Removed all tests from FileSystemWatcher that made calls to File.Move and consolidated them into a new file: FileSystemWatcher.MoveFile.cs. This new file separates tests into Windows and Unix categories and uses Theories to supply the input WatcherChangeType and whether a move should trigger an event for the given type. If we later decide to change the Unix behavior of MoveFile, changing the FileSystemWatcher tests will be a simple matter of flipping the boolean values for the affected tests.

(I'm assuming it can't be removed, but figured I'd ask anyway). >  > If it can't be removed, should the default value be changed to `false` to reflect the actual behavior? However, this would go against the [MSDN documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w6x28886%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) for the desktop framework, which states the default value is `true`.

""On July 8, 2013, the Israeli Knesset approved the bill to extend IDT even further. According to the bill, IDT will begin on the Friday before the last Sunday of March, and end on the last Sunday of October."" From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Summer_Time  So this might not be the last Friday of the month.  Some years it is the last Friday of the month, some years it is the 2nd to last.

Here the TimeSpan Offset = 26 hours, and month = 3, week = 4, day = 4.  The ""TimeOfDay"" property would be ignored in this case.

Creating a DirectoryInfo with a short path, or creating it from a parent (eg: CreateSubdirectory, EnumerateDirectories,etc) returns just the directory name.  On CoreCLR we are always trimming to just the directory name.  I traced this behavior back to an IFDEF in the original code https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/src/System/IO/DirectoryInfo.cs#L639-L643.  It seems that the original CoreCLR implementation (Silverlight/phone) hardcoded the short name.  We should prefer the desktop behavior instead of the current. The current behavior is due to the legacy behavior of SL trying to sandbox the app. This is not a goal for CoreCLR and we don't have a back-compat burden for the current implementation.  We also need to examine similar cases in other FileSystem types.

2648	area-System.ComponentModel	RangeAttribute with string constructor fails on various locales	"`RangeAttribute(Type, string, string)` can be used to validate various types implementing `IComparable`. However, it does the conversion from the string parameters using the current culture, which is wrong.  Simple repro:  ``` Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo(""fr""); new RangeAttribute(typeof(decimal), ""0.1"", ""0.9"").IsValid(123m) ```  fails with a `FormatException`: _0.1 is not a valid value for Decimal._  While in this sample the strings could be adjusted at runtime to represent numbers using the current culture, the typical usage of an attribute is  ``` [Range(typeof(decimal), ""0.1"", ""0.9"")] public decimal Value { get; set; } ```  where the values **must** be constants, and can't change depending on the culture.  Culprit line:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.ComponentModel.Annotations/src/System/ComponentModel/DataAnnotations/RangeAttribute.cs#L203  The fix can't be to simply change `CurrentCulture` to `InvariantCulture` here, since this will alter the runtime validation behavior: `InvariantCulture` should be used to convert the `min` and `max` parameters (maybe falling back to `CurrentCulture` for back-compat, if the constructor was used directly), but `CurrentCulture` should be kept to validate the user-entered value.  If accepted, I can add some unit tests and a fix for this issue. "

2703	area-System.Threading	Add a way to wait for a task without throwing	`Task.Wait` throws an exception if the task is faulted or cancelled. Sometimes it is necessary to wait for completion but not be interrupted by an exception.  Catching and swallowing the exception is a really bad workaround. Using exceptions for control flow is not a good thing. Also, exceptions are extremely slow. 1. The `Wait` method should have an overload that allows the caller to specify that he does not want an exception. 2. There should be a method `Task WhenCompleted(this Task task)` that returns a new task that becomes completed when the base task becomes completed. Cancellation and exceptions should not be propagated. That way we can write `await myTask.WhenCompleted()` to avoid exceptions. 3. In the same spirit as (2) there probably should be `WhenCompletedSuccessfully`, `WhenCancelled` and `WhenFaulted`. These tasks complete when the underlying task transitions to the respective state. They do not ever complete if the underlying task transitions to a different final state. They should _not_ become cancelled in that case because the idea of these methods is that you can avoid exceptions for control flow in a convenient manner.

2727	area-System.Collections	IsPrime function unnecessary, GetPrime function inefficient.	In System.Collections.HashHelpers and System.Collections.NonGeneric\src\System\Collections\Hashtable and System.Private.DataContractSerialization\src\System\Runtime\Serialization\ObjectToIdCache.cs  there are copies of the same function: private static bool IsPrime(int candidate)  It is used by: private static int GetPrime(int min)  Which is called by: Initialize, ExpandPrime, and TrimExcess  They all use a table in GetPrime: E.g. int[] primes = {3, 7, 17, 37, 89, 197, 431, 919, 1931,...7199369}. Notice that each successive prime is larger than twice the preceding one. This appears to be because hashtables are doubled in size when they need to be expanded. But they are only allowed to expand up to 2G. The GetPrime function calls IsPrime to find a prime when the search goes above the limit of the primes table. The ExpandPrime function is the most interesting as it more than doubles the size each time: public static int ExpandPrime(int oldSize)         {             int newSize = 2 \* oldSize;             ....          return GetPrime(newSize);  Therefore it appears that we don't need the IsPrime function at all. Instead we simply need to expand the primes table up to 2146435069 (largest prime below 2G).  {..., 7199369, 21598111, 64794337, 194383039, 583149179, 1749447569, 953375459, 2146435069};  Recommendation: 1) Use a common GetPrime(int min) function instead of having three copies 2) Expand the primes table as described above. 3) Remove the IsPrime function, modify GetPrime to only use the table. 
2729	area-System.Numerics	Fix very sporadically failing Complex test	"I'd previously ""fixed"" this same test by incorporating infinity support, but I needed to do the comparisons based on IsNegative/PositiveInfinity rather than by comparing the values directly.  cc: @mellinoe  "
2730	area-System.IO	Reworked the tests for System.IO.Pipes	I made a number of changes to our current Pipes tests and added several hundred new tests for edge cases that were previously ignored, particularly with Named Pipes defined with an InOut PipeDirection - Refactored the great Throws tests currently in place to allow testing pipes with all in/out direction combinations for both Named pipes as well as Anonymous pipes - Replaced all relevant hardcoded pipe names with unique values - Reorganized the tests to use more inheritance and share more code for easy extensibility - All test classes are now in the same namespace: System.IO.Pipes.Tests - Expanded tests for InOut NamedPipes and made all existing In/Out tests also test all valid InOut combinations. - Split the Named and Anonymous tests into two separate folders: NamedPipeTest and AnonymousPipeTest - Increased code coverage across all test classes 
2732	area-System.Numerics	what set's Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated to true in System.Numerics.Vectors?	I am writing a test app, 64 bit using System.Numerics.Vectors 4.1.0. I am trying to understand how `Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated` gets set to true. Ive tried running this on three Haswell based systems. I get `Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated` as false during debugging. But when I run it from command prompt, I get true in one system and false in other two system.

2743	area-System.Security	PlatformNotSupportedException on Unix when exporting multiple private keys in a single PFX	The beta7 PFX/PKCS12 export code will use OpenSSL's PKCS12_create function, which only supports one private key.  OpenSSL doesn't have an inherent limitation against PKCS12 files containing multiple private keys, but the helper function can't handle it; and we're running out of time in beta7 to write it out longhand. 
2745	area-System.Security	Not all private keys are available when importing a PFX with multiple private keys on Unix	The OpenSSL helper function `PKCS12_parse` only emits a single private key (and its associated certificate), the rest of the certificates appear, but as public-key only.  Similar to #2743, the fix would be to not use the helper function, but to get into the nitty-gritty with PKCS12 primitives. 
2746	area-System.Security	CryptographicException on Unix when exporting an empty collection as a PFX	This has the same underlying function as a cause as #2743, `PKCS12_create`.  Since it never added anything to an authsafe it never created the authsafe stack, and then reports a data validation error because it didn't expect a `NULL` to make it through.  When/if we switch to creating PFX files without the helper function's limitations this should go away (but it's a separate problem, and could accidentally not be fixed, so a separate issue). 
2751	area-System.Diagnostics	Trace.IndentLevel does not behave consistently when used from multiple threads	"According to [the documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.trace.indentlevel), `Trace.IndentLevel` should be stored on a per-thread basis. And [it is](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/41e203011152581a6c65bb81ac44ec037140c1bb/src/System.Diagnostics.TraceSource/src/System/Diagnostics/TraceInternal.cs#L16), but [a cached version is also kept in each `TraceListener`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/41e203011152581a6c65bb81ac44ec037140c1bb/src/System.Diagnostics.TraceSource/src/System/Diagnostics/TraceListener.cs#L18). And since listeners are shared among all threads and the listener-cached version of `IndentLevel` is updated only when `Trace.IndentLevel` changes on some thread, this means that the actual indent level that is printed is the indent level of the last thread that changed it, it doesn't matter what the indent level of the current thread is.  Sample application to replicate the issue:  ``` c# using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; using System.Threading.Tasks;  namespace TraceIndentLevel {     static class Program     {         static void Main()         {             Trace.Listeners.Add(new ConsoleTraceListener());              Task.WaitAll(Task.Run((Action) T1), Task.Run((Action) T2));         }          static readonly Barrier barrier = new Barrier(2);          static void T1()         {             Trace.Indent();             Trace.Indent();              Trace.TraceInformation(""Thread 1, IndentLevel should be {0}."", Trace.IndentLevel);              barrier.SignalAndWait();             barrier.SignalAndWait();              Trace.TraceInformation(""Thread 1, IndentLevel should be {0}."", Trace.IndentLevel);              // this should be a noop, but isn't             Trace.IndentLevel = Trace.IndentLevel;              Trace.TraceInformation(""Thread 1, IndentLevel should be {0}."", Trace.IndentLevel);         }          static void T2()         {             barrier.SignalAndWait();              Trace.TraceInformation(""Thread 2, IndentLevel should be {0}."", Trace.IndentLevel);              Trace.Indent();              Trace.TraceInformation(""Thread 2, IndentLevel should be {0}."", Trace.IndentLevel);              barrier.SignalAndWait();         }     } } ```  On my computer (using desktop .Net, but I believe core will behave the same), this prints:  ```         TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 1, IndentLevel should be 2.         TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 2, IndentLevel should be 0.     TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 2, IndentLevel should be 1.     TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 1, IndentLevel should be 2.         TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 1, IndentLevel should be 2. ```  What I would expect is that the value returned by `Trace.IndentLevel` and the actual indent level matched:  ```         TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 1, IndentLevel should be 2. TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 2, IndentLevel should be 0.     TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 2, IndentLevel should be 1.         TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 1, IndentLevel should be 2.         TraceIndentLevel.exe Information: 0 : Thread 1, IndentLevel should be 2. ``` "

2757	area-System.IO	DirectoryInfo.GetFiles killed by privileged folders 	The seemingly useful DirectoryInfo.GetFiles method (with the SearchOption.AllDirectories parameter) is unreliable because any access control check failure causes it to bomb out with an exception rather than returning files that _are_ accessible to the user.  For instance, call this on any drive root from a non-elevated process and you'll get:  `Access to the path 'D:\$RECYCLE.BIN\S-1-5-18' is denied. Type: System.UnauthorizedAccessException Source: mscorlib    at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath)    at System.IO.FileSystemEnumerableIterator``1.AddSearchableDirsToStack(SearchData localSearchData)    at System.IO.FileSystemEnumerableIterator``1.MoveNext()    at System.Collections.Generic.List``1..ctor(IEnumerable``1 collection)    at System.IO.DirectoryInfo.InternalGetFiles(String searchPattern, SearchOption searchOption)`  The API should be smart enough to skip enumerating folders to which it doesn't have permission, or it should offer some sort of callback or parameter to permit doing so.
